    <h1>COMMENTS</h1>
    <p>Comments are just <b>plain text</b>, totally <b>ignored</b> by the JavaScript interpreter, that usually serve to explain a certain piece of code, 
        which for some reasons may not be fully legible. However, we cannot write them completely freely, as the interpreter will try to treat them 
        as commands, variable names, or keywords. So JavaScript needs to distinguish comments from the rest of the code. In JavaScript, <b>we have two
        types of comments</b>, and both are commonly used in many programming languages, from the C language family to Python. They are called <b>single-line</b> 
        and <b>multi-line comments</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>1: SINGLE LINE COMMENT</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This is the primary way to comment code. It uses a <b>double slash character</b> at the start of the comment that spans to the end of the line. 
        Any code placed to the right of the double slash will be ignored by the interpreter. If we want to create comments in this way over several lines, 
        we have to put "<b>//</b>" in each line separately.
        <br>
        <br>
        In most modern code editors, it is possible to "comment" selected code fragments using <b>keyboard shortcuts</b>. This means that we can place the cursor in the selected 
        line of code and by pressing a specific combination of keys we can place a comment sign at the beginning of the line. Pressing the same combination again will "uncomment" the comment character.

        This method is most often used for "commenting" (i.e. temporarily disabling) a selected piece of code, for example, <b>to test an alternative version of it</b>.

        <br>
        <b>2: MULTI-LINE COMMENT</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Multi-line comments, also known as <b>block comments</b>, allow for comments to span multiple lines, but also allow you to place comments inside a line, 
        which is not possible with single-line comments. They are created with a <b>slash and an asterisk at the start of the comment</b> and an <b>asterisk and a slash at the end</b>.
