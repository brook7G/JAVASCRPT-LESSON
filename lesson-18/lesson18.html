    <h2 id="spePara">PARAMETERS VALIDATION</h2>
    <p>
        Remember how we said that we sometimes use the return keyword to interrupt functions in the case of errors? A
        good example is the validation of function parameters.
        <br><br>
        Let's go back to the example with the <b id="spePara">get_temp_mean_</b> function. The last version we wrote
        needs an array of numbers as an argument. Before starting the calculation,
        we can check if the value passed to it is actually an array.
    <pre>
            <code>
                function get_temperature_mean_(temperatures) {
                    if (!(temperatures instanceof Array)) {
                      return NaN;
                    }
                    let sum_of_Temperatures_ = 0;
                    for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
                      sum_of_Temperatures_ += temperatures[i];
                    }
                    return sum_of_Temperatures_ / temperatures.length;
                  }
                  //
                  console.log(get_temperature_mean_(10)); //NaN
                  console.log(get_temperature_mean_([10, 30])); // 20
                  
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">RECURSION</h2>
    <p>
        During your math lessons, you probably came across the concept of factorials. A factorial is a function,
        indicated by an exclamation mark in mathematical notation.
        We pass an integer to this function and its result is obtained by multiplying all integers from the number 1 to
        the number given as an argument.
        Formally, you define a factorial as follows:
    <pre>
            <code id="spePara">
                n!=n∙(n-1)∙(n-2)∙... ∙2∙1

                So, for example, the factorial of 6 is:

                6!=6∙5∙4∙3 ∙2∙1=720
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
        Let's try to write a function that will calculate the factorial from the given number.
        <br><br>
        It will take the parameter n and return the calculated value.
    <pre>
                <code>
                    function factorial(num) {
                        let result = 1;
                        while (num > 1) {
                          result *= num;
                          num--;
                        }
                        return result;
                      }
                      console.log(factorial(5)); // 120
                </code>
            </pre>
    <p>
        In this case, we use the iterative approach to calculate the factorial, in other words, we use a loop in which,
        during each iteration we multiply the previous result by another element of the sequence.
        <br><br>
        After the first iteration, the result is 6, after the second, 30, after the third, 120, and so on.
        The iterations are repeated to the last significant element of the
        sequence, that is, to the value 2 (hence the condition of ending the loop n > 1).
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the definition of a factorial can be written in a slightly different way.
        It will be the factorial of the previous element <b id="noticed">n - 1</b> multiplied by <b id="">n</b>.
        <br><br>
        <b id="front">For example</b>, 6! is 5! multiplied by 6. Such a factorial definition uses the recursion,
        i.e. referring a function to itself (but with a different argument).
        A recursion is a mechanism that allows to simplify the formal notation of many mathematical functions and
        present them in an elegant form.
        We can also successfully use recursion in programming.
        <br><br>
        Let's declare the <b id="spePara">factorial</b> function again, this time using recursion.
    <pre>
                <code>
                    function factorial_1(num_1) {
                        return num_1 > 1 ? num_1 * factorial_1(num_1 - 1) : 1;
                      }
                      console.log(`factorial of num1: [${factorial_1(4)}]`); // factorial of num1: [24]
                </code>
            </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to get a shorter, more compact code, instead of an if conditional instruction, we use the ternary
        conditional operator.
        In it, we check if the argument n is greater than 1. Depending on that, we return either the result of
        multiplying the number n by
        the result of the factorial(n – 1) call, or the value 1. The figure below shows a sequence of factorial function
        calls starting
        from a call for the value 6 (the arrows show where the value from the called function is returned)
        <img src="/lesson-18/factorial.png" alt="">
        Recursion is commonly used in programming. However, as with any solution, recursion must be handled with care.
        We shouldn't use it where we can't estimate the number of embedded calls.
        <br><br>
        We should also be very careful in formulating the condition that will interrupt the function sequence calls –
        errors can cause the program to suspend.
    </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">FUNCTIONS AS FIRST-CLASS MEMBERS</h2>
    <p>
        In JavaScript, functions are first-class members. This term means that functions can be treated as any data,
        which can be stored in variables or passed as arguments to other functions. For example,
        we can declare the showMessage function and then store it in the variable <b id="spePara">sm</b>.
    <pre>
            <code>
                function showMessage(message) {
                    console.log(`Message: ${message}`);
                  }
                  //
                  let sm = showMessage;
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
        We can store any function that is accessible in this scope in a variable and use a
        function call operator () to execute it. We can check that the sm variable is now a function
        by using the typeof operator.
    <pre>
                <code id="spePara">
                    sm("THIS IS BULLSHIT"); // Message: THIS IS BULLSHIT
                    console.log(typeof sm); // function
                </code>
            </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        But it’s important to remember that when assigning a function to a variable, we don't use a function call
        operator,
        as this would execute the function and assign the result of the function to a variable, and not to the function
        itself.
    <pre>
                <code>
                    function do_nothing() {
                        return undefined; //
                      }
                      //
                      let a = do_nothing(); // assign result of function call
                      let b = do_nothing; // assign function
                      //
                      console.log("type-of -a :", typeof a); // type-of -a : undefined
                      console.log("type-of -b :", typeof b); // type-of -b : function
                </code>
            </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example, the result of the doNothing function call (i.e. the undefined value returned by the function) is
        stored in the a variable, while the doNothing function itself is stored in the b variable (or more precisely, a
        reference to the function is stored in the b variable).
        <br><br>
        This property is especially useful when passing the function as a call parameter to other functions,
        which we will soon learn more about. For now, let's test that something like this is actually feasible.
    <pre>
                <code>
                    function add(a, b) {
                        return a + b;
                      }
                      function multipy(a, b) {
                        return a * b;
                      }
                      function divide(a, b) {
                        return a / b;
                      }
                      function operation(func, first, second) {
                        return func(first, second);
                      }
                      
                      console.log(operation(add, 10, 20)); // 30
                      console.log(operation(multipy, 10, 20)); // 200
                      console.log(operation(divide, 10, 20)); // 0.5
                </code>
            </pre>
    <p>
        The operation function takes as its first argument the function (parameter func) and
        calls it with the other two arguments passed (parameters first and second).
    </p>
    </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">FUNCTIONS EXPRESSIONS</h2>
    <p>
        To store a function in a variable or pass it as an argument to call a function,
        you do not necessarily have to declare it previously and use its name.
        <br><br>
        Let's go back to our example with the add function:
    <pre>
            <code>
                function add_1(a, b) {
                    return a + b;
                  }
                  //
                  let myAdd_1 = add_1;
                  console.log(myAdd_1(10, 20)); // 30
                  console.log(add_1(10, 30)); // 40
                  
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
        We first declare the add function, and then store it in the variable <b id="spePara">myAdd_1</b>.
        We can call the same function using both the name add and the variable <b id="spePara">myAdd_1</b>.
        We can shorten this notation and declare the function by storing it in a variable.
    <pre>
                <code>
                    let myAdd_2 = function add2(a, b) {
                        return a + b;
                      };
                      //
                      console.log(myAdd_2(40, 20)); //60
                      console.log(add2(80, 20)); //100
                </code>
            </pre>
    <p>
        In the example, we again declare the add function, and at the same time store it in the myAdd variable.
        <br><br>
        This form of defining a function is called function expression. In this case, it is specifically a named
        function expression, because the function has a name (add). If there is a named function expression,
        there will probably also be an unnamed, or precisely, an anonymous function expression. In fact, simply
        remove the name following the function keyword to change the function from named to anonymous.
    <pre>
                    <code>
                        let myAdd_3 = function (a, b) {
                            return a + b;
                          };
                          //
                          console.log(myAdd_3(30, 50)); // 80
                    </code>
                </pre>
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's go back to the concept of anonymous functions. It may seem a little incomprehensible when you use a
        name (although it is a variable name) to refer to a function. In this case, it's about anonymity,
        i.e. the lack of a name, in the very definition of a function. This will be much more evident when passing a
        function as a
        call parameter to another function.
        <br><br>
        Let's look at the example:
    <pre>
                <code>
                    function operation_2(func, first, second) {
                        return func(first, second);
                      }
                      //
                      let myAdd_4 = function (a, b) {
                        return a + b;
                      };
                      //
                      //
                      console.log(operation_2(myAdd_4, 20, 50)); // 70
                      //
                      console.log(
                        operation_2(
                          function (a, b) {
                            return a * b;
                          },
                          20,
                          50
                        )
                      ); // 1000
                </code>
            </pre>
    <p>
        In the first step, we declare the function operation (it is a named function, and we use the function statement
        here,
        so we will refer to the function by its name). In the next step, we define an anonymous function,
        which we store in the <b id="spePara">myAdd_3</b>. variable (we use a function expression). We call the
        operation function, passing the <b id="spePara">myAdd_3</b>.
        function and values 20 and 50 as arguments.
        <br><br>
        The result is easy to predict. It only gets interesting when we call the <b id="spePara">operation</b> function
        again. This time,
        the first argument is the anonymous function (again the function expression), which is defined directly in an
        operation call.
        <br><br>
        The result is a multiplication, although the name of the new function (or the variable in which it could be
        placed) will not appear anywhere.
        The function has been defined only to pass it once into the operation function. At first glance, it may look
        like a completely useless mechanism,
        but in the real world, it is used very often.
    </p>
    </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">CALLBACKS</h2>
    <p>
        Functions that are passed as arguments to other functions may seem quite exotic and not very helpful, but in
        fact, they are a very important part of programming.
        So important that they even get their own name. They are callback functions. As we have seen in previous
        examples,
        a function that receives a callback as an argument can call it at any time.
        Importantly, in our examples, the callback is run synchronously, that is, it is executed in a strictly defined
        order resulting from where it is placed among the other instructions.

    <h2 id="spePara">Synchronous callbacks</h2>
    <p>
        <b id="noticed">synchronous</b> execution is the most natural way to see how the program works. Subsequent
        instructions are executed in the order in which they are placed in the code.
        If you call a function, the instructions in it will be executed at the time of the call. If we pass another
        function to this function as an argument,
        and we call it inside an outer function as well, then all instructions will keep their natural order.
    <pre>
                <code>
                    let inner = function () {
                        console.log("inner 1");
                      };
                      //
                      let outer = function (callback) {
                        console.log("outer 1");
                        callback();
                        console.log("outer 2");
                      };
                      //
                      //
                      console.log("test 1");
                      outer(inner);
                      console.log("test 2");
                      
                </code>
                <u id="front">OUTPUT</u>
                test 1
                outer 1
                inner 1
                outer 2
                test 2
            </pre>
    <p>
        Therefore, the order of actions resulting from the order of calling the commands and functions is maintained.
        However, this order may be disturbed under certain special circumstances.
    </p>
    </p>

    <h2 id="spePara">ASYNCHRONOUS CALLBACKS</h2>
    <p>
        <b id="noticed">Asynchronous</b> operation of programs is a rather complex topic,
        strongly dependent on a particular programming language, and often also on the environment.
        <br><br>
        In the case of client-side JavaScript running in a browser, it is limited to event-based programming, i.e. the
        asynchronous
        response to certain events.
        An event can be a signal sent by a timer, a user action (e.g. pressing a key or clicking on a selected interface
        element),
        or information about receiving data from the server.
        <br><br>
        Using appropriate functions, we combine a specific type of event with a selected callback function, which will
        be called when the event occurs.
        <br><br>
        One of the simplest cases when there is an asynchronous execution of instructions is the use of the <b
            id="spePara">setTimeout</b> function.
        This function takes another function (a callback) and the time expressed in milliseconds as arguments. The
        callback function is executed after the specified time,
        and meanwhile, the next program instruction (placed in the code after <b id="spePara">setTimeout</b>) will be
        executed.
        <br><br>
        Thus, the moment the callback function is called is not determined by its order, but by an arbitrarily imposed
        delay.
        The delay only applies to the callback function given to <b id="spePara">setTimeout</b>, while the rest of the
        code is still executed synchronously.
        <br><br>
        Let's modify the previous example a bit. In the outer function, we do not call <b id="spePara">callback()</b>
        immediately,
        but pass it to <b id="spePara">setTimeout</b>, which executes it with a delay of 1000 milliseconds (one second).
    <pre>
                <code>
                    let inner_2 = function () {
                        console.log("inner 1");
                      };
                      //
                      let outer_2 = function (callback) {
                        console.log("outer 1");
                        setTimeout(callback, 1000);
                        console.log("outer 2");
                      };
                      //
                      console.log("test 1");
                      outer_2(inner_2);
                      console.log("test 2");
                      
                </code>
                <u id="front">OUTPUT</u>
                test 1
                outer 1
                outer 2
                test 2
                .....
                inner 1
            </pre>

    <h2 id="spePara">
        <span id="speTitle" style="font-size: 3.9vw;">setTimeout
        </span>AND <span id="speTitle" style="font-size: 3.9vw;">setInterval</span> FUNCTIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <b id="spePara">setTimeout</b> function is used when you want to cause a delayed action. A similar function is <b id="spePara">setInterval</b>. 
        This time, the action is also performed with a delay, but periodically, so it is repeated at fixed intervals. In the meantime, the main program is executed, 
        and at every specified time, the callback given as an argument for a setInterval call is called.
        <br><br>
        Interestingly, the setInterval function returns an identifier during the call, which can be used to remove the timer used in it 
        (and consequently to stop the cyclical callback function call). We will do this in the next example. 
        First, we run setInterval, which will call the callback function (i.e. the inner function) in one-second intervals. 
        Then we call setTimeout, which will turn off the timer associated with the previously called setInterval after 5.5 seconds. As a result, the inner function should be called five times. 
        In the meantime, the rest of the program will be executed ...
