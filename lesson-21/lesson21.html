    <h2 id="speH1">1.<span id="spePara">Testing and debugging your code</span></h2>
    <p>
        As we have already written, errors in programs happen. It is completely normal. At the beginning, you will mostly make errors resulting from a lack of knowledge of 
        the programming language (e.g. syntax errors). They will be easy to correct, because the interpreter will detect them and usually will also suggest what is wrong. 
        Logical errors, however, are a different problem. As we showed earlier, the interpreter has no way of detecting them, so we have to look by ourselves for the answer to the question: 
        why does the program not work as we assumed it would?
        <br><br>
        Let’s look at a simple example:
        <pre>
            <code>
                function average(a, b) {
                    return a + b / 2;
                }
                 
                console.log(average(2, 10));   // -> 7 expected: 6
                console.log(average(5, 5));    // -> 7.5 expected: 5
                
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            We see a function that calculates the average of two numbers and returns the result. The function looks simple – it adds two given numbers and divides them by 2. 
            This code has valid syntax, there are no formal problems with it, and we expect the results of the two calls in the example to be 6 and 5. But when we run this code, 
            the results are very different. Can you see where the error is?
            <pre>
                <code>
                    return a + b / 2; 
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            This doesn’t work as expected (dividing the sum of two numbers by 2) because of the order of the operations. The division b / 2 is calculated first, 
            then a is added, so this code is the same as this:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    return a + (b / 2);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                and to produce the result we expect, the code should look like this:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        return (a + b) / 2;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a good example of a logical error. The code itself is perfectly valid, nothing to complain about from the JavaScript point of view. But the function doesn't return the values that the programmer intended. 
            Most of the time, these kinds of errors are the hardest to find if the code is not tested properly.
            <br><br>
            Here we have another example where the error is not so obvious:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function largest(a, b, c) {
                        if (a > b && a > c) {
                            return a;
                        } else if (b > a && b > c) {
                            return b;
                        } else {
                            return c;
                        }
                    }
                    
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            We see a function that should return the largest of three numbers. The idea of how to solve this problem is simple: when variable <b id="spePara">a</b> is bigger than 
            <b id="spePara">b</b> and <b id="spePara">c</b>, <b id="spePara">a</b> is the largest number. If this is not the case, 
            then if <b id="spePara">b</b> is bigger than <b id="spePara">a</b> and <b id="spePara">c</b>, <b id="spePara">b</b> is the largest number. 
            If neither is true, that means that <b id="spePara">c</b> is the largest number.
            <br><br>
            Take some time and try to spot the flaw in this logic. As a hint, try to call the largest function with these sets of parameters:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    console.log(largest(1, 1, 2)); // -> 2
                    console.log(largest(1, 2, 3)); // -> 3
                    console.log(largest(3, 2, 1)); // -> 3
                    console.log(largest(2, 2, 1)); // -> 1

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Can you now spot the error based on when it occurs?
                <br><br>
                If the first and second numbers are equal, the function incorrectly returns the third value. This is due to the fact that when a and b are equal, 
                both <b id="spePara">a > b</b> and <b id="spePara">b > a</b> are not true. This error is much harder to find, as this code does what it should most of the time, and only in specific cases does it return incorrect values.
                When found, the problem is rather easy to fix, as we only need to change the greater than operator to a greater than or equal to operator inside our <b id="spePara">if</b> statement.
            </p>
        </p>
    </p>

    <h2 id="speH1">2. <span id="spePara">Debugging</span></h2>
    <p>
        To be conducted efficiently, debugging requires tools, and if our code is executed in the browser, we almost certainly have all the necessary tools already available.
        <br><br>
       To check if our browser supports this functionality, we can simply try to execute this code with the developer console opened.
       <pre>
        <code>
            console.log("Before debugger");
            debugger;
            console.log("After debugger");

        </code>
       </pre>
       <p>
        If the debugger is present, the console will show only the "Before debugger" log, and depending on the installed browser, we should see information about code execution either stopped, or paused in the debugger, or in debug mode. 
        The second log message is not displayed because the debugger statement works as a breakpoint in the code execution. So whenever JavaScript encounters the debugger statement, it checks if the debugger is present, and if so, 
        code execution is halted at that exact point. This of course is not helpful by itself, but this is only the beginning of the features of the debugger.

       </p>
    </p>

    <h2 id="speH1">3. <span id="spePara">Step-by-step program execution</span></h2>
    <p>
        One of the main features of the debugger is its ability to execute code on a step-by-step basis. This means that we can stop program execution at any place using a <b id="spePara">debugger</b> statement, 
        and then continue execution one instruction at a time.
        <br><br>
        This is really helpful when we suspect that the program behavior or logic is flawed, and the code goes to an incorrect branch of execution (it goes to the wrong <b id="spePara">if</b> statement, etc.). 
        In this mode, we can see each line that is executed, and each line that is not. We can easily see if the logic in the flow control statements is valid or not.
        <br><br>
        So we know already that the debugger statement, when encountered by JavaScript, will stop code execution at that place. Depending on the browser we’re using, the flow control buttons can look different, 
        and can be located in different places. In general, all modern browsers support the following options to control the execution of the script in debug mode:
        <br><br>
        <b id="spePara">Resume / Continue</b>. This will resume the execution of the script in a normal way, and is used when we’ve checked what we wanted to check, and now we want to continue with the execution of the script.
        <br><br>
        <b id="spePara">Step Into</b>. This executes the next instruction in the code only, and pauses it again, and we use this when we want to analyze the code in detail, or check which exact path the execution takes 
        when complex branching is happening due to cascading if...else statements, or other complicated logic. If the next instruction is a function call, using Step Into will jump inside the code of this function.
        <br><br>
        <b id="spePara">Step Over</b>. This works like Step Into, except that if this is used when the next instruction is a function call, the code will not jump into the function code, 
        but the whole function will be executed, and the program will be paused again after jumping out of this function. This is often used when the next instruction is a call to a function where we 
        don’t know if it will have any impact, or we’re simply not interested in looking.
        <br><br>
        <b id="spePara">Step Out</b>. This allows us to immediately jump out of a function in which the code is paused.
        <br><br>

        Let's try to practice some basic actions that can be performed with the debugger.
        <br><br>
        The JavaScript program we will be debugging should be rewritten in your local development environment (for some reason, debugging is more readable if we don't use our platform in these exercises).
        <br><br>
        Remember how you can do something like this? At the beginning of the course, we ran our code by opening a simple HTML file in the browser, 
        which included a reference to the JavaScript file to be run (the chapter titled "The Hello, World! Program").
