    <h3>The <span id="spePara">break</span> and <span id="spePara">continue</span> statement</h3>
    <p>
        The <b id="speTitle">break</b> statement is used to terminate the execution of a loop or a switch statement. In each of these contexts, whenever the JavaScript engine encounters a 
        <b id="speTitle">break</b> statement, it exits the whole loop or switch statement, and jumps to the first statement after that loop or switch.
        <br><br>
        In the example, we can see an infinite <b id="speTitle">while</b> loop that will be exited using <b id="speTitle">break</b> after the variable <b id="speTitle">i</b> becomes 
        greater than or equal to 5. Such a use of <b id="speTitle">break</b> is only of illustrative importance, because it would make more sense to include this 
        condition directly in the <b id="speTitle">while</b> construction.
        <pre>
            <code>
                let i = 0;
                while (true) {
                  console.log(i);
                  if (i >= 5) {
                    break;
                  }
                }
                alert(`Exited the loop with (${i}).`);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Just like <b id="speTitle">break</b>, <b id="speTitle">continue</b> can be used in loops (but not in the switch statement). When used, it applies to the closest surrounding loop. 
            The continue statement, in contrast to break, does not end the whole loop, but rather starts the next iteration of this loop.
            <br>
            We can think of it as jumping right to the end of the current iteration.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let i = 0;
                    // An infinite loop
                    while (true){
                        console.log(i);
                        i++;
                        if (i >= 5) {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    alert(`Exited the loop with a break (${i}).`);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Just like break, continue can be used in loops (but not in the switch statement). When used, it applies to the closest surrounding loop. 
                The continue statement, in contrast to break, does not end the whole loop, but rather starts the next iteration of this loop.

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                            if (i == 3) {
                                continue;
                            }
                            console.log(i);
                        }
                        
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                The program writes numbers from 0 to 9 to the console, but skips the number 3. 
                This happens because when <b id="speTitle">i</b> equals 3, the continue statement is executed, 
                ending this iteration (and skipping the <b id="speTitle">console.log</b> statement) and starting another one.
                <br><br>
                Both break and continue are not used particularly often. We should definitely not use them when we can terminate the loop with a properly constructed condition. 
                They are useful in emergency situations, when something unusual happens in loops with more complex iterations.

        <h3>The <span id="spePara">break</span> keyword</h3>
        <p>
            We also need to say a few words about the <b id="speTitle">break</b> keyword. 
            In the example, the <b id="speTitle">break</b> keyword is present in all cases except in the <b id="speTitle">default</b> case. In contrast to <b id="speTitle">if</b> statements, 
            switch statements do not execute just one branch, but rather they execute the entire code from the first case that matches until the end of the switch statement. 
            This behavior is called pass-through and has some uses, but most of the time we want to execute only one branch, and for that reason the break keyword is present. 
            When a JavaScript interpreter comes to a <b id="speTitle">break</b>, it will jump out of the current <b id="speTitle">switch</b> statement.
