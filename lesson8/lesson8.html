    <h1>OPERATORS</h1>

    <p>Operators in programming languages are <b>symbols</b> (sometimes also <b>names</b>) that are used to perform certain actions on arguments called <b>operands</b>. 
       <br>
       <br>
     <b>Operands</b> can be both <b>values</b> and <b>variables</b>. We have encountered operators several times in previous examples, for example, the assignment symbol <b>=</b> or the keyword <b>typeof</b>.
        <br><br>
             Operators can be categorized in several ways. They are distinguished, for example, by the number of operands they work on.
        <br><br>
             The addition operator <b>+</b> is a typical <b>binary operator</b> (it uses <b>two operands</b>), while the <b>typeof</b> operator is <b>unary</b> (it uses only <b>one operand</b>).

        <br>
             In JavaScript, there is also one <b>ternary operator</b> (operating on <b>three operands</b>), about which we will say a few words in a moment.
             <br>
             <br>
             We can differentiate between <b>prefix operators</b> (occurring before the operand), <b>postfix operators</b> (after the operand) and <b>infix operators</b> (between operands). However, 
             itâ€™s common to categorize operators according to the context in which they are used: so we have <b>assignment</b>; <b>arithmetic</b>; <b>logical</b>; or <b>conditional</b> operators. 
             We will further review the basic JavaScript operators according to this classification. 

             <p>
                <h3>1.ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</h3>
                Let's start with the <b>assignment</b> operators. In this group, there are operators that allow for the <b>assigning of values to variables and constants</b>. 
                The basic assignment operator is the equals sign "<b>=</b>", which we have already seen many times in the examples. This operator <b>assigns</b> the <b>value</b> of the <b>right operand</b> to the <b>left operand</b>.

                <h3>2.ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS</h3>
                <b>Arithmetic</b> operators express <b>mathematical</b> operations, and they accept numerical values and variables. All arithmetic operators, except <b>addition</b>, will try to implicitly convert values to the Number type before performing the operation.

                The <b>addition</b> operator will convert everything to a String if any of the operands is a String type, otherwise it will convert them to a Number like the rest of the arithmetic operators. <br><br><br>The order of the operations is respected in JavaScript like in math, 
                and we can use parentheses as in math to change the operation order if needed.
                <br><br>
                The <b>basic binary</b> arithmetic operators are the addition "<b>+</b>", subtraction "<b>-</b>", multiplication <b>*</b>, division "<b>/</b>", division remainder "<b>%</b>" and power "<b>**</b>". 
                Their operation is analogous to what we know from mathematics, and the easiest way to trace them is to use an example:check your JavaScript file :
