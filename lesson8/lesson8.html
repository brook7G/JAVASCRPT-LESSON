    <h1>OPERATORS</h1>

    <p>Operators in programming languages are <b>symbols</b> (sometimes also <b>names</b>) that are used to perform certain actions on arguments called <b>operands</b>. 
       <br>
       <br>
     <b>Operands</b> can be both <b>values</b> and <b>variables</b>. We have encountered operators several times in previous examples, for example, the assignment symbol <b>=</b> or the keyword <b>typeof</b>.
        <br><br>
             Operators can be categorized in several ways. They are distinguished, for example, by the number of operands they work on.
        <br><br>
             The addition operator <b>+</b> is a typical <b>binary operator</b> (it uses <b>two operands</b>), while the <b>typeof</b> operator is <b>unary</b> (it uses only <b>one operand</b>).

        <br>
             In JavaScript, there is also one <b>ternary operator</b> (operating on <b>three operands</b>), about which we will say a few words in a moment.
             <br>
             <br>
             We can differentiate between <b>prefix operators</b> (occurring before the operand), <b>postfix operators</b> (after the operand) and <b>infix operators</b> (between operands). However, 
             it’s common to categorize operators according to the context in which they are used: so we have <b>assignment</b>; <b>arithmetic</b>; <b>logical</b>; or <b>conditional</b> operators. 
             We will further review the basic JavaScript operators according to this classification. 

             <p>
                <h3>1.ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</h3>
                Let's start with the <b>assignment</b> operators. In this group, there are operators that allow for the <b>assigning of values to variables and constants</b>. 
                The basic assignment operator is the equals sign "<b>=</b>", which we have already seen many times in the examples. This operator <b>assigns</b> the <b>value</b> of the <b>right operand</b> to the <b>left operand</b>.
                <br>

                <h3>2.ARITHMETIC OPERATORS</h3>
                <b>Arithmetic</b> operators express <b>mathematical</b> operations, and they accept numerical values and variables. All arithmetic operators, except <b>addition</b>, will try to implicitly convert values to the Number type before performing the operation.

                The <b>addition</b> operator will convert everything to a String if any of the operands is a String type, otherwise it will convert them to a Number like the rest of the arithmetic operators. <br><br><br>The order of the operations is respected in JavaScript like in math, 
                and we can use parentheses as in math to change the operation order if needed.
                <br><br>
                The <b>basic binary</b> arithmetic operators are the addition "<b>+</b>", subtraction "<b>-</b>", multiplication <b>*</b>, division "<b>/</b>", division remainder "<b>%</b>" and power "<b>**</b>". 
                Their operation is analogous to what we know from mathematics, and the easiest way to trace them is to use an example:check your JavaScript file :

             </p>

             <p>
                <h3>3.UNARY ARITHMETIC OPERATORS</h3>
                There are also several <b>unary</b> arithmetic operators (<b>operating on a single operand</b>). Among them there are the plus "<b>+</b>" and minus <b>-</b> operators.
                <br>
                <br>
                Both operators <b>convert operands</b> to the Number type, while the minus operator additionally negates it.
             </p>

             <p>
                <h3>4.UNARY INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATORS</h3>
                Among the arithmetic operators, we also have at our disposal the unary <b>increment ++</b> and <b>decrement  - -</b> operators, in both <b>prefix</b> and <b>postfix</b> versions. 
                They allow us to <b>increase</b> (increment) or <b>decrease</b> (decrement) the value of the operand by <b>1</b>.
                <br>
                <br>

                These operators in the <b>postfix version</b> (i.e. the operator is on the right side of the operand) performs the operation by changing the value of the variable, but <b>returns the value before the change</b>. 
                The <b>prefix version</b> of the operator (i.e. the operator is placed before the operand) performs the operation and <b>returns the new value</b>.
                
             </p>
             <img src="unary.png" alt="">  
             <p>
               keep in mind that the <b>Number</b> type is a <b>floating-point</b> type, which means that the <b>results</b> of some of the operations may be <b>imprecise</b>.
               <img src="imprecises.png" alt="">
               <br><br>
               These are artefacts of floating-point arithmetic. The number will be precise for integers up to <b>252</b>, but fractions may not be as precise, as many fractions are impossible to directly represent in binary format. 
               We’ll discuss how to mitigate this in a moment when we introduce comparison operators.
             </p>

             <p>
               <h3>5. COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</h3>
               Binary arithmetic operators can be combined with the assignment operator, resulting in the <b>addition</b> assignment <b>+=</b>, the <b>subtraction</b> assignment <b>-=</b>, the <b>multiplication</b> assignment <b>*=</b>, the <b>division</b> assignment <b>/=</b>, the <b>remainder</b> assignment <b>%=</b>, and the <b>power</b> assignment <b>**=</b>.
               <br><br>
               Each of these <b>operators</b> takes a <b>value</b> from the variable to which the assignment is to be made (the <b>left operand</b>) and <b>modifies</b> it by <b>performing an arithmetic operation </b>using the <b>right operand</b> value. The <b>new value</b> is assigned to the <b>left operand</b>.
