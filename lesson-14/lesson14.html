    <h1>LOOPS</h1>
    <h2>What are loops?</h2>
    <p>
        <p>
            In programming, loops are the second form of flow control statement. Together with conditional execution statements like if and switch, 
            they allow for almost infinite freedom in how the application can work from an algorithmic point of view. While conditional statements 
            are able to change code behavior (allowing us to decide during program execution whether a certain piece of code is to be performed or not), 
            loops are an easy way to repeat any fragment of the code as many times as we want, or until some condition is met. 
            There are a few types of loops in JavaScript, but we can loosely split them into two categories:
            <br><br>
            <p id="subPara_">
                    loops that are repeated a given number of times<br>
                    loops that continue until some condition is met.
            </p>
            
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2>The <span id="speTitle">while</span> Loop</h2>
    <p>
        So we know that loops allow us to execute a selected piece of code multiple times. But what would be the purpose of this? Imagine that in the program, 
        we have created an array containing information about system users. If we wanted to display the name of each of them on the console, 
        we would have to write console.log as many times as there are users. For example, for 100 users we write 100 console.log calls one under another. 
        It would look rather weird, wouldn't it? Instead, we can use a loop that calls the same console.log command 100 times, but for each subsequent array element. 
        Each iteration of the loop will refer to the successive user. In a moment, we will learn how to use different loops.
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Let's start with an example where we do not use a loop. 
            Our goal is to write out the consecutive numbers <b id="normal">0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90</b> on the console.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    console.log("0");    //0
                    console.log("10");   //10
                    console.log("20");   //20
                    console.log("30");   //30   
                    console.log("40");   //40   
                    console.log("50");   //50
                    console.log("60");   //60
                    console.log("70");   //70   
                    console.log("80");   //80    
                    console.log("90");   //90 
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                All in all, we have achieved our effect, but it looks a bit strange. We repeat the same command ten times, one by one. 
                At first sight, it may seem that the commands are not exactly the same. Yes, each time we call the console.log, 
                but each time a different literal appears as an argument: 0, 10, 20, and so on.
                <br>
                <br>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let n = 0;
                        console.log(n); //0
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //10
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //20
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //30
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //40
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //50
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //60
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //70
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //80
                        n+=10;
                        console.log(n); //90
                        n+=10;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                We use the variable n, which we initialize with 0. Then we repeat this identical piece of code ten times: 
                we display the current value of the n variable on the console, and then increase this value by 10.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        console.log(n);
                        n+=10;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is exactly the situation in which we can use a loop. Using the while loop, we rewrite our code again. 
                We leave the declaration and initialization of the n variable unchanged. The repeating code fragment is enclosed in a separate code block, 
                and using the word while, we specify that it is to be executed as long as the value of variable n is less than 91.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let _n = 0;
                        while(_n < 91) {
                            console.log(_n);
                            _n+=10;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b id="speTitle">while</b> loop is so versatile that someone persistent enough could replace all other control flow instructions with while loops, 
                even <b id="speTitle">if</b> statements. Of course, it would be cumbersome at best. 
                The while loop is one of the loops that we normally use when we don't know exactly how many times something should be repeated, but we do know when to stop.
                The syntax of the while loop is as follows:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        while(condition){
                            block of code
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p id="spePara">
                The expression in parentheses is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. 
                If the condition is evaluated to true, the code in the curly brackets will be executed. 
                Then execution jumps back to the beginning of the loop, and the condition is evaluated again. 
                The loop will iterate, and the code will be executed as long as the condition is evaluated to true. 
                This means, of course, that with an ill-formed condition, a while loop can turn into an infinite loop, a loop without end. 
                Depending on the context, that may be what we want to achieve. Almost all computer games, 
                for example, are basically infinite loops that are repeating: reading input from the player, 
                updating the game state, rendering on screen as many times per second as necessary. This is a big simplification, but true nonetheless.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at one more example. <br><br>

            This time, the decision whether the loop is to end will be made by the user answering the question asked during each 
            iteration of the loop (we will use the confirm dialog we recently introduced).
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let is_over=false;
                    let counter = 1;
                    while(is_over != true){
                        let continue_loop = confirm(`[${counter}] continue the loop`);
                        is_over = continue_loop === true? false: true;
                        counter = counter + 1;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The loop will be repeated until the <b id="noticed">is_over</b> variable is set to <b id="noticed">true</b>. <br><br>

            In the loop, we display the question: <b id="noticed">"Continue the loop?"</b>, 
            which is preceded by the number of the iteration (the <b id="noticed">counter</b> variable).
            <br>
            Note that the <b id="noticed">counter</b> variable is not used in the while condition, as its role is only informative. 
            Clicking on the OK button in the confirm dialog will cause the <b id="noticed">continue_loop</b> variable 
            to be set to <b id="noticed">true</b> (otherwise it will be set to <b id="noticed">false</b>).
            <br>
            Based on the value from the <b id="noticed">continue_loop</b> variable, we set a new value for the <b id="noticed">is_over</b> variable. 
            Remember that the variable that is tested in the while condition should be initialized beforehand.
            <br>
            This is one of the most common mistakes of beginner programmers – they remember to change its value inside the loop, 
            but forget to set its value for the first test.

        </p>
        <p>
            The example is correct, but there is a lot of redundant code here, which is not really needed (we only did it in the first place so 
            that we could analyze the operation of subsequent instructions in a relatively simple way). 
            Exactly the same effect will be achieved by simplifying our code as shown below.

            Try to analyze exactly what the changes are about. We’ve used for this purpose, among others, the operators we recently learned.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let isOver = false;
                    let counter_ = 1;
                    while(!isOver){
                        isOver = !confirm(`[${counter_++}] continue the loop`);   
                    } 
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2>The <span id="speTitle">do...while</span> Loop</h2>
    <p>
        The <b id="speTitle">do ... while</b> loop is very similar to the plain <b id="speTitle">while</b> loop, the main difference being that in a while loop, 
        the condition is checked before each iteration, and in the <b id="speTitle">do ... while</b>loop, the condition is checked after each iteration.
        <br><br>
        This doesn’t seem like a big difference, but the consequence of this is that a <b id="speTitle">do ... while</b> loop 
        code is always executed at least once before the first condition check is done, and a plain <b id="speTitle">while</b> may 
        never be executed at all if the initial condition is evaluated to false at the beginning of the loop.
        <br><br>
        The syntax of the <b id="speTitle">do ... while</b> loop looks as follows:
        <pre>
            <code>
                do{
                    block of code
                }
                while(condition);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Let's rewrite our last example using <b id="speTitle">do ... while</b> instead of <b id="speTitle">while</b>. 
            Note that this time the <b id="speTitle">isOver</b> variable does not need to be initialized before the loop (the condition is checked at the end of the loop, 
            and the confirm dialog box will be called before the first test).
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let is_Over ;
                    let _counter =1;
                    do{
                        is_Over = !confirm(`using (do while): [${_counter++}] continue the loop`);
                    }
                    while(!is_Over);
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The behavior of the program will be identical to the previous one, in which we used while. 
            Compare both examples, and you should easily see the differences caused by using the different loop statements.
            <br><br>
            In the next example, we demonstrate what we said earlier – a <b id="speTitle">do ... while</b> loop always iterates at least once:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let condition = false;
                    while(condition){
                        console.log("A while loop iteration");
                    }
                    do{
                        console.log("A do while loop iteration")
                    }
                    while(condition);
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2>The <span id="speTitle">for</span> Loop</h2>
    <p>
        <p>The for loop is part of the second type of loops, the one which is better in situations where we know how many times the loop should be executed (although this is not necessary). 
            The syntax of the for loop is a bit more complicated and looks as follows:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    for(initialization;condition;increment){
                        block of code;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In the parentheses after the word for, we will not find a single condition this time, as was the case in the while loop. 
                The inside of the parentheses is divided into three fields by semicolons, and each field is assigned a different meaning. 
                In each of these fields, a statement may appear, which will be interpreted as follows in the order:
                <p id="subPara_">
                    loop initialization statement. <br>
                    loop condition statement. <br>
                    loop increment statement. <br>
                    

                </p>
                <p>All three statements are optional, but in fact we very rarely miss any of them. Let's take a closer look at them.</p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <h3>The <span id="speTitle">for</span> loop <b id="speTitle">initialization</b> statement</h3>
        <p>
            The initialization statement is executed only once, before the first loop iteration. Usually, it’s used to initialize (or declare and initialize) 
            a variable that will be used as a loop counter. 
            We can use any existing variable as a counter, but in general it’s good practice to declare a new one, as this makes the code cleaner and 
            easier to read and understand. The initialization statement is optional and can be left empty, except for ending with a semicolon.
        </p>
        <h3>The <span id="speTitle">for</span> loop <b id="speTitle">condition</b> statement</h3>
        <p>
            A condition statement is an expression that is evaluated to a Boolean before each loop iteration. 
            If this expression is evaluated to true, the loop will execute its code. In the case of the condition being evaluated to false, the loop is terminated, 
            and no more iterations will be executed, and the code execution jumps to the first statement after this for loop. The condition statement is also optional, 
            but if left empty, it will be assumed as always true, leading to an infinite loop if no other means of exiting the loop is used.
        </p>
        <h3>The <span id="speTitle">for</span> loop <b id="speTitle">increment</b> statement</h3>
        <p>
            The increment statement is always executed at the end of the current loop iteration, and most of the time it’s used to increment (or decrement, 
            depending on the need) a loop counter that is used in a condition statement. It can be any expression, not only incrementation/decrementation. 
            This can also be left empty.
            <br><br>
            It may look a bit complicated, but after the first simple example, everything should become clearer. 
            Using the for loop, we will try to write out successive integers from 0 to 9 on the console, so we will make ten iterations:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    for(let i=0; i<10; i++){
                        console.log(i);
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                As shown in the syntax of the for loop, there are three expressions inside the parentheses. The let <b id="speTitle">i = 0</b> 
                is an initialization,<b id="speTitle"> i < 10 </b>is a condition, and <b id="speTitle">i++</b> is an increment.
                <br><br>
                Now let's try to rewrite the same example using the while loop:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let i=0;
                        while(i<10){
                          console.log(i);
                          i++;  
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In both cases (for loop and while loop), we declare and initiate variable <b id="speTitle">i</b> before the loop starts (initially set to <b id="speTitle">0</b> ). 
                    Both loops will be executed as long as condition <b id="speTitle">i < 10</b> is fulfilled.
                    <br><br>
                    In both loops, at the end of each iteration, the value of variable <b id="speTitle">i</b> will be increased by <b id="speTitle">1</b>. 
                    And of course, in both loops in each iteration, the current value of variable <b id="speTitle">i</b> will be printed on the console.
                    <br><br>
                    So you can see that the for loop actually offers just a slightly different, more consistent way of writing the same thing that you can achieve with the while loop. 
                    Such a notation is particularly useful in cases such as the one presented in the example, where we use an iteration counter (in our example, 
                    the <b id="speTitle">i</b> variable), which must be initialized and incremented (or decremented). 
                    In such a situation, everything related to the counter (initialization, loop end condition, change of counter value) is located practically in one place, 
                    which may increase the readability of the code.

                        A typical example of using a for loop, where we know the number of iterations in advance, is when going through the elements of an array.
                        <br><br>
                        Let's move on to another simple example. Let's assume that we have a four-element array of integers at our disposal and our dream is to sum up all these numbers. 
                        There is nothing easier than to go through the array, taking the element one by one and adding them to the result. We just have to remember that before starting the loop,
                        the result is <b id="noticed">0</b>.
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                let values = [10,30,40,100]; // change the values in the array and check the result
                                let sum = 0;
                                for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++){
                                 sum += values[i]; //or you can change to > sum = sum +values[i];
                                 
                                }
                                console.log(sum); // 180
                            </code>

                            simple right?
                            <br><br>
                            But there is a slight awkwardness in the code.
                            <br>
                            We have set the number of iterations to four. It’s true that there are exactly four elements in the array, and in our example this number does not change, but it is not a universal rule.
                            <br>
                            In normal programs, arrays very often change dynamically during program execution (elements are added or removed). In this case, it is definitely better to use the array property called length (we mentioned it when discussing arrays).
                            <br>
                            This property contains the current number of array elements. So our example rewritten correctly will look like this:
                            <pre>
                                <code>
                                    let value = [10,30,40,100];
                                    let result = 0;
                                    for(let i = 0; i < value.length; i++){
                                      result += value[i];

                                    }
                                    console.log(result); // 180
                                </code>
                            </pre>
