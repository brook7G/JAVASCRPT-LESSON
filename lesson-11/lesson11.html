    <h1>1.INTERACTING WITH THE USER</h1>
        <p>
            Most of the programs we deal with on a daily basis are dependent on <b id="normal">user interaction</b>. 
            The user enters data, makes choices, and confirms the options given by the program. <br><br>
            Thanks to this interaction, the program can start to use the <b id="normal">data</b> that is provided to it by the user during its execution 
            (this data was not known when the program was started, nor was it known when it was written). <br>
            <b id="normal">Secondly</b>, the program can perform certain actions conditionally, in other words, the user influences not only the data, but also its execution.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the case of JavaScript, interaction with the user is quite a <b id="normal">complex topic</b>. This is for several reasons.
            Do you remember that we can write programs in this language both for use in the browser (<b id="normal">client-side</b> ) and to perform certain actions <b id="normal">on the server-side</b>? 
            This division influences the potential interaction. 
            <br>
            JavaScript programs written with <b id="normal" style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">node.js</b> for servers usually do not require such an interaction. 
            We run them from the console level, often without a graphic environment.
            <br><br>
            Most often, the <b id="normal">user gives</b> certain options (e.g. path data) to the program being run in this way in the form of a configuration file and/or as <b id="normal">call arguments</b>. 
            The data to run the program are then taken from <b id="normal">disk files, databases, network services,</b> etc. 
            <br>
            It is very rare for such console programs to need to enter some data while the program is running. 
            If it is necessary, it is indicated by the appearance of appropriate information on the console, on which you need to enter some data.
            <br><br>
            This is definitely different for client-side applications. In most cases, they require continuous interaction between the user and the program. Using them, we can click on buttons, 
            enter values into forms, select data from drop-down lists, and so on. The problem is that practically all elements used for this purpose are HTML components. 
            Using them may not be very difficult, but it does require at least a thorough understanding of the basics of the <b id="normal">DOM </b>(<b id="normal">Document Object Model</b> ) used in web pages, 
            and the basics of HTML itself.
            <br>
            <p id="noticed">An example of an HTML page that uses two elements for interaction, for which JavaScript code is used, is shown below: </p>

            <img src="inputBox.png" alt="">
        </p>


        <div class="userInput">
            <input id="myId" type="text" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
            <button style="color: #596235;background-color: white;" onclick="console.log(document.getElementById('myId').value)"><b>GO</b></button>

        </div>

        <p>
            The <b id="normal">< input ></b> element is an <b id="normal">input field</b> where you can enter any <b id="normal">text</b>. In our case, we’ve given this element the <b id="normal">myId</b> identifier. 
            The <b id="normal">< button ></button></b> element, as you can guess, corresponds to ... a button. Using the <b id="normal">onClick</b> attribute, we have indicated that if the button is clicked, 
            a piece of JavaScript code is to be run. In this code, we refer to the document object (a fragment of the DOM model), which represents our website. 
            We search for the element with the <b id="normal">myId identifier, retrieve its value</b> (i.e. the text entered) and print the result on the console.
            <br>
            As you can see, the idea is relatively simple, but both the DOM model and HTML language are definitely beyond the scope of the current course. 
            So how can we communicate with the user if we do not use these standard mechanisms?
            <br><br>
            There is another <b id="normal">solution</b>. Please note that it is not used in modern web applications, but it allows you to easily give the user the opportunity to enter data or make certain decisions. 
            We will use it in this course as a dummy for normal communication, rather than as an element that you will find useful in real programming. 
            The <b id="normal">solution is</b> to use <b id="normal">dialog boxes</b>
        </p>

    <h1>
        2.DIALOG BOX
    </h1>

        <p>
            <b id="normal">Dialog boxes</b> are integral parts of web browsers, and available in almost all of them, even really old ones. All of them are <b id="normal">popup windows</b> (or modal windows) which means that when the dialog box is displayed, 
            it isn’t possible to interact with the webpage itself until this dialog box is closed.
            <br><br>
            This inconvenience <b id="normal">when the popup is visible</b> is one of the reasons why <b id="normal">we shouldn’t overuse them</b>. They’re perfectly fine for the <b id="normal">learning process</b>, and in some rare cases where <b id="normal">important information</b> needs to be displayed, 
            or some input from the user is mandatory, but they should be avoided in other circumstances. We have three dialog boxes available to use.
