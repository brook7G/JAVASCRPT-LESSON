    <p>This is Lesson-3 of Learning JAVA SCRIPT. In this part of Lesson we are going to discuss about :</p>
    <h1>1.METHODS
        <p></p>
    </h1>
    <h1>2.AUTOBOXING
        <p></p>
    </h1>
    <h1>3.COMMONLY USED METHODS WITH STRING
        <p></p>
    </h1>
    <h1>4.UNDEFINED [DATA TYPE]
        <p></p>
    </h1>
    <h1>5.SYMBOL [DATA TYPE]
        <p></p>
    </h1>
    <P>
        The Symbol type is, well... complicated to say the least. And fortunately, not particularly useful to us.
        It’s a new primitive type that was added to JavaScript in 2015. It doesn't have any literal value, 
        and can only be created using a special constructor function. Symbols are a form of identifier that are guaranteed to be unique.
        Symbols are an advanced topic, and to understand their power and usefulness, 
        we’ll need to cover a lot of other topics first, so for now, just remember that the Symbol type exists.
