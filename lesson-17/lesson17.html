    <u><h2>Part-One</h2></u>
    <h2 id="spePara">FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>
        We talked about functions in the chapter on variables, when we discussed the scope of visibility of local variables declared with the keyword var. 
        We learned on this occasion what functions are, but in this chapter, we will take a much closer look at them, expanding our knowledge on the subject.
        <br><br>
        So <b id="front">what is function</b>? It's a separated piece of code, constituting a certain closed logical whole, intended to perform a specific task. 
        We usually assign a name to such a separated piece of code. With this name, we can call it (execute it) many times in different places of the program.
        <br><br>
        This is a simplification, because there are functions that do not have a name, for example, anonymous functions (we will talk about them later). 
        For the time being, let’s assume that a function has a name, which we give when declaring it. This name is used when calling the function, in other words, 
        when running the code contained in it.
        <br><br>
        The declaration and calling of functions are independent of each other, which we will see in a moment.
    </p>
    <h3 id="noticed">why do we use functions?</h3>
    <p >
        There are many reasons, one of the most important being to divide the code into some logically independent parts. 
        Such modularity increases the readability of the code – it is easier to write and analyze a long program that is not a sequence of single instructions.
        It also allows for easy testing of code fragments closed in functions independently of the rest of the program.
        <br><br>
        A very important reason for using a function is the reuse of code – if you repeat the same sequence of instructions in the program in many places, 
        you can close this sequence in a function, and in those places you only have to call the function.
        <br><br>
        Apart from reducing the amount of code in a program (thus increasing its readability), 
        it also means that if you need to make some changes in this sequence of instructions, 
        you have to do it only once, inside the function. If we didn’t use a function in this situation, 
        we would have to make changes independently in every place where this sequence of instructions appeared in the code.
        <br><br>
        Let's take a look at a simple program, written without any functions.
        <pre>
            <code>
                let temperatures;
                let sum;
                let mean_Temp;
                //

                temperatures = [
                12, 12, 11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 24, 23, 25, 25, 23, 21,
                20, 19, 17, 16,
                ];
                sum = 0;
                //

                for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
                sum += temperatures[i];
                }
                //

                mean_Temp = sum / temperatures.length;
                console.log(`mean : ${mean_Temp}`); // mean : 16.666666666666668
                //
                //

                temperatures = [
                17, 16, 14, 12, 10, 10, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 27, 29, 29, 27, 26, 24,
                21, 19, 18, 17, 16,
                ];
                sum = 0;
                //

                for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
                sum += temperatures[i];
                }
                //

                mean_Temp = sum / temperatures.length;
                console.log(`mean : ${mean_Temp}`); // mean : 18.083333333333332

            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The program will calculate and display the mean daily temperature on the basis of the provided data (24 temperature measurements, in hourly intervals, 
            starting from midnight). In the program, we declare the variable temperatures, which will be a 24-element table containing the obtained measurements.
            <br><br>
            We have measurements for two successive days, for which we will make calculations. The mean temperature is of course calculated by summing up all values 
            and dividing the result by their number.
            <br><br>
            At first glance, you can see that the code fragment responsible for a calculation is repeated twice. In two places of the program, 
            we use the same sequence of instructions, so it would be worth thinking about creating a function out of them.
            <br><br>
            We will do it in several stages, introducing some new concepts related to functions. Let's start with a function declaration.
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">DECLARING FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>
        As with variables, functions need to be declared before we can use them. The syntax for function declaration looks like this:
        <pre>
            <code>
                function function_name() {
                    block of code;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This type of function declaration in JavaScript is called a function statement. 
            A function statement starts with the <b id="front">function</b> 
            keyword followed by the function name. Function names need to follow the same rules as variable names, 
            and should also be meaningful. After the function name, there are parentheses that can optionally have function parameters, 
            which we’ll discuss in a while. After the parentheses comes the function body, 
            which is made from any number of statements (a code block).
            <br><br>
            So let's try to declare a function according to these rules, which will contain a fragment of our program code calculating 
            the mean daily temperature. We will call it <b id="front">getMeanTemp</b>. For now, the function will use variables, 
            declared outside of it (in the surrounding context). In fact, it is practically never done that way, 
            but we will deal with it at one of the subsequent stages.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let temperature;
                    let sum_of_Temperature ;
                    let temp_mean;

                    //
                    //declare function

                    function get_temp_mean() {
                    sum_of_Temperature = 0;
                    for (let i = 0; i < temperature.length; i++) {
                        sum_of_Temperature += temperature[i];
                    }
                    temp_mean = sum_of_Temperature / temperature.length;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
