    <u><h2>Part-One</h2></u>
    <h2 id="spePara">FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>
        We talked about functions in the chapter on variables, when we discussed the scope of visibility of local variables declared with the keyword var. 
        We learned on this occasion what functions are, but in this chapter, we will take a much closer look at them, expanding our knowledge on the subject.
        <br><br>
        So <b id="front">what is function</b>? It's a separated piece of code, constituting a certain closed logical whole, intended to perform a specific task. 
        We usually assign a name to such a separated piece of code. With this name, we can call it (execute it) many times in different places of the program.
        <br><br>
        This is a simplification, because there are functions that do not have a name, for example, anonymous functions (we will talk about them later). 
        For the time being, let’s assume that a function has a name, which we give when declaring it. This name is used when calling the function, in other words, 
        when running the code contained in it.
        <br><br>
        The declaration and calling of functions are independent of each other, which we will see in a moment.
    </p>
    <h3 id="noticed">why do we use functions?</h3>
    <p >
        There are many reasons, one of the most important being to divide the code into some logically independent parts. 
        Such modularity increases the readability of the code – it is easier to write and analyze a long program that is not a sequence of single instructions.
        It also allows for easy testing of code fragments closed in functions independently of the rest of the program.
        <br><br>
        A very important reason for using a function is the reuse of code – if you repeat the same sequence of instructions in the program in many places, 
        you can close this sequence in a function, and in those places you only have to call the function.
        <br><br>
        Apart from reducing the amount of code in a program (thus increasing its readability), 
        it also means that if you need to make some changes in this sequence of instructions, 
        you have to do it only once, inside the function. If we didn’t use a function in this situation, 
        we would have to make changes independently in every place where this sequence of instructions appeared in the code.
        <br><br>
        Let's take a look at a simple program, written without any functions.
        <pre>
            <code>
                let temperatures;
                let sum;
                let mean_Temp;
                //

                temperatures = [
                12, 12, 11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 24, 23, 25, 25, 23, 21,
                20, 19, 17, 16,
                ];
                sum = 0;
                //

                for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
                sum += temperatures[i];
                }
                //

                mean_Temp = sum / temperatures.length;
                console.log(`mean : ${mean_Temp}`); // mean : 16.666666666666668
                //
                //

                temperatures = [
                17, 16, 14, 12, 10, 10, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 27, 29, 29, 27, 26, 24,
                21, 19, 18, 17, 16,
                ];
                sum = 0;
                //

                for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
                sum += temperatures[i];
                }
                //

                mean_Temp = sum / temperatures.length;
                console.log(`mean : ${mean_Temp}`); // mean : 18.083333333333332

            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The program will calculate and display the mean daily temperature on the basis of the provided data (24 temperature measurements, in hourly intervals, 
            starting from midnight). In the program, we declare the variable temperatures, which will be a 24-element table containing the obtained measurements.
            <br><br>
            We have measurements for two successive days, for which we will make calculations. The mean temperature is of course calculated by summing up all values 
            and dividing the result by their number.
            <br><br>
            At first glance, you can see that the code fragment responsible for a calculation is repeated twice. In two places of the program, 
            we use the same sequence of instructions, so it would be worth thinking about creating a function out of them.
            <br><br>
            We will do it in several stages, introducing some new concepts related to functions. Let's start with a function declaration.
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">DECLARING FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>
        As with variables, functions need to be declared before we can use them. The syntax for function declaration looks like this:
        <pre>
            <code>
                function function_name() {
                    block of code;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This type of function declaration in JavaScript is called a function statement. 
            A function statement starts with the <b id="front">function</b> 
            keyword followed by the function name. Function names need to follow the same rules as variable names, 
            and should also be meaningful. After the function name, there are parentheses that can optionally have function parameters, 
            which we’ll discuss in a while. After the parentheses comes the function body, 
            which is made from any number of statements (a code block).
            <br><br>
            So let's try to declare a function according to these rules, which will contain a fragment of our program code calculating 
            the mean daily temperature. We will call it <b id="front">get_temp_mean</b>. For now, the function will use variables, 
            declared outside of it (in the surrounding context). In fact, it is practically never done that way, 
            but we will deal with it at one of the subsequent stages.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let temperature;
                    let sum_of_Temperature ;
                    let temp_mean;

                    //
                    //declare function

                    function get_temp_mean() {
                    sum_of_Temperature = 0;
                    for (let i = 0; i < temperature.length; i++) {
                        sum_of_Temperature += temperature[i];
                    }
                    temp_mean = sum_of_Temperature / temperature.length;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

        </p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">CALLING FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>
        To call a function, we need to write a function name and follow it with parentheses. Our complete example should therefore look like this:
        <pre>
            <code>
                let temperature_2;
                let sum_of_Temperature_2;
                let temp_mean_2;

                function get_temp_mean_2() {
                sum_of_Temperature_2 = 0;
                for (let i = 0; i < temperature_2.length; i++) {
                    sum_of_Temperature_2 += temperature_2[i];
                }
                temp_mean_2 = sum_of_Temperature_2 / temperature_2.length;
                }
                //
                //
                temperature_2 = [
                12, 12, 11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 24, 23, 25, 25, 23, 21,
                20, 19, 17, 16,
                ];
                get_temp_mean_2();
                console.log(`mean : ${temp_mean_2}`); // mean : 16.666666666666668
                //
                temperature_2 = [
                17, 16, 14, 12, 10, 10, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 27, 29, 29, 27, 26, 24,
                21, 19, 18, 17, 16,
                ];
                get_temp_mean_2();
                console.log(`mean : ${temp_mean_2}`); // mean : 18.083333333333332
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            At the beginning of the program, after the variable declaration, we have the <b id="front">get_temp_mean_2</b> function declaration.
            <br><br>
            In the later part of the code, we call it twice by writing <b id="front">get_temp_mean_2()</b>. Each call causes the program to jump into the function code, 
            execute its instructions and return to the next instruction after the function call.
            <br>
            Simple, isn't it? 
            <br><br>
            Usually, functions are declared before they are called, mostly at the beginning of the code. However, this is only a good practice, 
            which increases the readability of the code, not a JavaScript syntax requirement. Function declarations are automatically moved to the 
            top of the scope, so we can use them before the declaration, as long as they are in the scope.
            <br><br>
            So the code:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    

                    let name = 'Biruk Fekadu';
                    //
                    //declaring before calling

                    function get_user_info(){
                    console.log(`user-name : ${name}`);
                    }
                    //
                    //calling the function

                    get_user_info(); // user-name : Biruk Fekadu
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                will work exactly the same as:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let user_name = "Fekadu Tolesa";
                        get_user_name(); // user-name : Fekadu Tolesa
                        //
                        function get_user_name() {
                        console.log(`user-name : ${user_name}`);
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre> 
                <p>
                    So we already know what a <b id="front">declaration and a function call are</b>. It is time to take a closer look at its contents. 
                    Let's start with the variables we use in it.
                </p>
            </p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">FUNCTIONS - local variables</h2>
    <p>
        Let's try to make a small change to our program calculating the mean temperature.
        <br><br>
        Do you remember what local variables are?
        <br><br>
        This is how we call the variables that are declared and used in some limited scope 
        and are not visible in the whole program, which means that we can only use them inside that particular scope.
        <br><br>
        Variables declared with the <b id="spePara">let</b> keyword are local inside the code block (i.e. inside the range limited by curly brackets), 
        while variables declared with the var keyword are local inside the function block. So if you declare a variable inside a function block, 
        whether using let or var, it will only be visible (and usable) inside the function block. This is very useful, 
        because usually the variables you use inside a function are not needed outside of it.
        <pre>
            <code>
                let temperature_3;
                let temp_mean_3;
                //
                //declaring function
                function get_temp_mean_3() {
                let sum_of_Temperature_3 = 0;
                for (let i = 0; i < temperature_3.length; i++) {
                    sum_of_Temperature_3 += temperature_3[i];
                }
                temp_mean_3 = sum_of_Temperature_3 / temperature_3.length;
                }
                //
                //
                temperature_3 = [12, 12, 11, 11, 10, 9, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 24, 23, 25, 25, 23, 21, 20, 19, 17, 16];
                get_temp_mean_3();
                console.log(`mean : ${temp_mean_3}`); // mean : 16.666666666666668
                //
                temperature_3 = [17, 16, 14, 12, 10, 10, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 22, 27, 29, 29, 27, 26, 24, 21, 19, 18, 17, 16];
                get_temp_mean_3();
                console.log(`mean : ${temp_mean_3}`); // mean : 18.083333333333332
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            In our code, an example of such a variable is <b id="spePara">sum_of_Temperature_3</b>.
            <br><br>
            Although we have declared it outside the <b id="spePara">get_temp_mean_3</b> function (it is a global variable), we only refer to it inside 
            the function. A global declaration is therefore unnecessary.
            <br><br>
            Let's put it in order, declaring <b id="spePara">sum_of_Temperature_3</b> locally.
            <br><br>
            The behavior of the program is the same, but the code has gained some clarity. The sum variable is now local, it can only be used inside the
            <b id="spePara">get_temp_mean_3</b> function (which is enough for us, because it was not needed for anything outside the function). <br><br>
            In general, we should strive to keep the function code as separate from the surrounding context as possible, among other things by 
            not using global variables inside it.In our example, there are two more such variables: temperatures and meanTemp.The latter, meanTemp, 
            is used inside the function to store and return the calculated result.
            <br><br>
            Let's deal with it.
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">THE <span id="front" style="font-style: italic; font-family: monospace;">return</span> STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>
        Functions that have been called execute a sequence of instructions contained in their body. 
        The result of this execution may be a certain value that we may want to store in some variable. 
        The return keyword comes to help us in this case. What exactly is <b id="front">return</b> for?
        <br><br>
        <li id="list"><b id="front">First</b>, it causes the function to end exactly where this word occurs, even if there are further instructions.</li>
        <li id="list"><b id="front">Second</b>, it allows us to return a given value from inside the function to the place where it was called.</li>
        <p>
            Let's move away for a moment from our example with mean temperature calculation and play with a slightly simpler code. 
            The <b id="front">showMsg</b> function contains only two <b id="spePara">console.logs</b> separated by return.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function showMsg() {
                        console.log("Message-1");
                        return;
                        console.log("Message-2");
                      }
                      showMsg(); // Message-1
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                As expected, the call ends up displaying only the first message "message 1", then the <b id="front">return</b> interrupts the function. 
                In practice, using <b id="front">return</b> here would not make much sense. It causes the <b id="front">console.log("message 2")</b> to never be called. 
                So it would be easier not to write a second <b  id="front">console.log</b> call at all.
                <br><br>
                However, using the conditional instructions, we can, for example, react to errors inside the function, and in certain situations interrupt the function immediately.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            As we said, <b id="front">return</b> allows us not only to terminate a function. If we place some expression (literal, variable, function call) immediately after the return keyword, 
            the value of this expression will be returned by the completed function to the place where it was called. You can then, for example, assign the returned value to a variable. 
            Let's take a look at an example of the getTrue function.
            <br><br>
            In the example, we declare a simple <b id="front">getTrue</b> function, which always returns true. Pay attention to the function call – we store the result of this call in the test variable. 
            As you can guess, this variable will have the true value.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function getTrue() {
                        return true;
                      }
                      //
                      let test = getTrue();
                      console.log(test); // true
                </code>
            </pre>
