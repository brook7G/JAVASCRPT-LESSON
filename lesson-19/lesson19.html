    <h1 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ERRORS</span> AND <span id="spePara">EXCEPTIONS</span> Part-1</h1>
    <p>
        It is really important to brace yourself for this simple truth:
        <br><br>
        <b id="noticed">Errors will happen.</b><br><br>
        You have certainly witnessed, multiple times, different applications malfunctioning, becoming unstable, returning unexpected results, or even shutting down uncontrollably. 
        Unfortunately, we, the programmers, are responsible for most of these. Even if we didn't cause these problems directly, we probably didn't anticipate certain situations 
        that could lead to a program malfunctioning (e.g. lack of a network connection).
        <br><br>
        Errors in the operation of programs happen. We have to accept that, while trying to minimize their number and mitigate the damage they can potentially cause. 
        We can make errors at every stage of software development, from wrong design to common typos in the code we write. The errors will be the result of a 
        misconception when trying to solve a certain problem, the wrong use of the programming language, or the inability to predict strange user behavior. 
        Unfortunately, bugs in the code causing errors are an integral part of programming.
        <br><br>
        This fact is best expressed by the words of one of the founders of modern computer science, 
        Edsger W. Dijkstra:  "<b id="spePara">If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in</b>".
        <br><br>
        <b id="noticed">Natural Languages and Communication Errors</b>
        <br><br>
        Programming languages are not by chance called languages. Just like natural languages, languages we use to communicate with other people, 
        programming languages are used to precisely formulate unambiguously interpretable sentences (instructions). And just like natural languages, 
        they have their grammar and vocabulary.
        <br><br>
        Grammar, or formally, the syntax of a programming language, is a set of rules defining the structure of the instructions (that is, the sentences of natural language). 
        These rules are usually very precise and specify, for example, the order in which we write certain keywords or operators.
        <br><br>
        Each language also has its own limited vocabulary, which is a list of words that can be used 
        to build instructions (that is, again, the sentences of a natural language). This picture is quite simplified, 
        but it should allow us to understand what errors can occur when using the language. To begin, 
        we will try to present the difference between various categories of errors using natural language, in this case, written English.
        <br><br>
        <h2 id="spePara">Natural languages and communication errors</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine that you are organizing a party by the lake for your friends. As the organizer, you explain to everyone how to get there, but as always in such situations, 
            someone gets lost. They’re almost there, but then they send a text message asking for additional tips. You send an answer, in which you tell them to turn right on 
            the first path after leaving the forest, and then drive for another 500 meters. Since you are still on your way, you ask them to wait on the spot. 
            The correct message could look like this: <br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn right into the first path, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            This is a sentence that we can treat as an instruction, unambiguously describing a certain procedure. 
            What would happen if we rushed when writing this information? Let's start with the missing punctuation marks: <br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">after leaving the forest turn right into the first path and drive 500m wait on the spot</b>
            <br><br>
            This is an example of a <b id="noticed">syntax error</b> (or more precisely, errors). In English, a declarative sentence should end with a period. 
            Probably the person who receives this message will easily guess what it is about, but formally it will be incorrect and ambiguous. 
            The interpreter (e.g. the JavaScript engine) or compiler cannot guess the meaning of what we have written. If such an error occurs, 
            it will require us to correct it. Such errors are usually very easy to detect automatically, and always need to be corrected. 
            They violate the language syntax rules. The program will not run if it contains a syntax error.
            <br><br>
            Let's restore the punctuation marks, but change one of the words, replacing “path” with the misspelled “pth”.
            <br><br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn right into the first <b style="color: red;">path</b>, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            Again, the recipient will probably guess what it is about, but the interpreter cannot afford to guess what the word “pth” may stand for, 
            because it does not know the meaning of such a word. Such an error is also easy to detect, because the word “pth” is not in the vocabulary of our language. 
            This is a <b id="noticed">semantic error</b>. In compiled programming languages, this type of error will not allow the compiling and running of the program. 
            In JavaScript, the interpreter will start the program and stop its execution after reaching such an instruction. 
            This specific type of semantic error in JavaScript is called a <b id="noticed">reference error</b>.
            <br><br>
            What happens if we replace a word by a typo with one that exists in our dictionary?
            <br><br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn right into the <b style="color: red;">fist</b> path, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            This time we’ve lost the letter “r” in the word “first” and got the word “fist”. If the sentence is analyzed by a person, 
            they will feel that something is wrong and start looking for an error – the word “fist” absolutely does not match the sentence, and they will probably guess what to replace it with. 
            This type of error will no longer be so easy to detect for an interpreter. The word is in the vocabulary, and the analysis has to be done in a broader context. It is also a semantic error.
            <br><br>
            The last category is logical errors. They are by far the hardest to find, because from a formal point of view, everything will look correct. We should tell our friend to turn right, 
            but busy with something else we rush to write ... left.
            <br><br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn <b style="color: red;">left</b> into the first path, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            Formally, everything looks correct: syntax, vocabulary, context. The information is consistent and unambiguous. And obviously incorrect. 
            The error will not be detected until someone tries to follow this instruction and disappears somewhere in the wilderness.
            <br><br>
            The last two errors may look quite similar at first glance, but they describe two completely different situations. 
            A logical error makes it possible to execute the instruction, but it will give the wrong result. An instruction with a semantic error will make no sense, 
            so most likely it will not be possible to execute it at all in this form. 
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ERRORS</span> AND <span id="spePara">EXCEPTIONS</span> in Javascript</h2>
    <p>
        Let's try to generate syntax, semantic, and logical errors in JavaScript, for tests in a controlled way. Let's say we want to write a simple arrow function called multiply, 
        which will multiply the two provided arguments:
        <pre>
            <code>
                let multiply = (a b) => a + b; // -> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
                let result = multiply(10, 20);
                console.log(result);

            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            In the example, there is a typical syntax error: we’ve forgotten about the comma between the parameters of the multiply function. 
            The error is detected by the JavaScript engine, which does not allow us to execute the program. We correct it, but we also make another error:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let multipl = (a, b) => a + b;
                    let result = multiply(10, 20); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: multiply is not defined
                    console.log(result);

                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, we have a typo in the name of the declared function: instead of multiply, we’ve written multipl. In the call, we use a multiply name, which does not exist. 
            This is a semantic error, in this case easy to detect, because there is no function with this name. The execution of the program is interrupted at the line of the error. 
            Pay attention to two things. First of all, the error messages displayed in the console quite precisely determine what and where something goes wrong – read this information carefully, 
            as it will help to get rid of the error. The second thing is the beginning of the message – <b id="spePara">Uncaught ....</b> 
            If an error can be uncaught, it can probably be caught. And indeed it is, as we will see in a moment.
            <br><br>
            First, however, let's correct the error and run the program again:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let multiply_ = (a, b) => a + b;
                    let result_ = multiply_(10, 20);
                    console.log(result_); // -> 30 ?

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Success, no mistakes have been made! But ... the result is slightly suspicious: 30 is certainly not the result of multiplying 10 by 20. Of course, the code is still not correct, 
                as the function is supposed to be used for multiplication, but by mistake we have inserted an addition sign instead of multiplication. This is a typical logical error, 
                impossible to detect automatically. From a formal point of view, everything is constructed correctly, but the logic of our function is incorrect 
                (we’re making it do something different to what we intended). The JavaScript interpreter is not able to detect such errors, 
                because it cannot know what we plan to achieve by writing such a function.
                <br><br>
                Let's correct it once again:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
                        let result = multiply(10, 20);
                        console.log(result); // -> 200

                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            When JavaScript detects syntactic or semantic errors, it generates and <b id="spePara">throws</b> specific objects containing information about the encountered error. 
            Usually, in such a situation, we say that an error has been thrown. In the case of syntax errors, the JavaScript engine does not allow us to run the program, and on the console, 
            we receive information about what is incorrect.  Errors other than syntax errors (e.g. semantic errors) are generally called <b id="spePara">run-time</b> errors in JavaScript. 
            They appear while the program is running. We can also call them <b id="spePara">exceptions</b>.By default, thrown exceptions interrupt program execution and cause the appropriate 
            information to appear on the console (we observed this in our example with the <b id="spePara">multiply</b> function). Let's generate the erroneous situation again:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    console.log('abc'); // -> abc
                    conole.log('def'); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: conole is not defined
                    console.log('ghi');

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The typo in the word console is a semantic error, in JavaScript called a <b id="spePara">ReferenceError</b>. JavaScript does not know a word like conole. As you can see, the program will stop working 
                only at the second line, and it will still be able to execute the first line correctly. It is possible to prevent the program from stopping in such a situation. 
                This is called exception handling (or more generally, error handling). 
                To handle exceptions generated in JavaScript (as in many other languages) we use the <b id="spePara">try...catch</b> statement.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        try {
                            console.log('abc'); // -> abc
                            conole.log('abc');
                        } catch (error) {  
                            console.log(error.message); // -> conole is not defined 
                        }
                        
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    If an exception is thrown in the code block after the try keyword, the program does not interrupt completely, but jumps to the part of the code after the catch keyword, 
                    and continues from there. We'll take a closer look at this construction shortly.
                </p>
            </p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ERRORS</span> WITHOUT <span id="spePara">EXCEPTIONS</span> ?</h2>
    <p>
        In JavaScript, not all erroneous situations throw exceptions. Many of them are handled in a slightly different way. The best example are <b>arithmetic errors</b>.
        <pre>
            <code>
                console.log(100 / 0); // -> Infinity
                console.log(100 * "2"); // -> 200
                console.log(100 * "abc"); // -> NaN

            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            None of the above commands will generate an exception, although they don't look like the most correct arithmetic. Dividing by zero will result in an <b id="spePara">Infinity</b> value. 
            Multiplication of a number by a string, which will represent a number, will automatically convert this string to a number (and then perform multiplication). 
            An attempt to perform an arithmetic operation on a string that does not represent a number (i.e. that cannot be converted) will result in <b id="spePara">NaN</b> (not a number). 
            At least two of these cases are clearly wrong (the first and the third), but instead of exceptions, the information about the error is the specific value that is returned.
            <br><br>
            Let's look at one more example:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    console.log(Math.pow("abc", "def")); // -> NaN

                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, we use the pow method of <b id="spePara">Math</b>, which is used to raise a given number to the given power. The <b id="spePara">Math</b> object will be discussed in the next parts of the course, 
            but at this point it is enough for us to say that <b id="spePara">Math.pow</b> is simply a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of their power. 
            However, the two strings of characters we’ve provided to this function are hard to call numbers. The function does not generate an exception, however, but returns the <b id="spePara">NaN</b> value.
            <br><br>
            The conclusion is quite simple – if you are learning about a new function or operator, you have to check in the documentation (e.g. on the MDN page) how they behave in the case 
            of errors. Some of them will generate exceptions, while others will return some specific values. Depending on that, you will be able to properly prepare yourself for 
            handling errors using the try method or simple conditional instructions. By the way, for the examples just shown, the most sensible solution would be to check if the 
            provided values really are numbers (remember the <b id="spePara">typeof</b> operator?).
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">LIMITED CONFIDENCE</span></h2>
    <p>
        Programs are not run in a vacuum. Usually during their execution, there are interactions with users (e.g. entering data needed to calculate certain values) or 
        other programs or systems (e.g. downloading data from the server). The behavior of both users and other systems should be treated with caution, 
        and we cannot assume that the user will provide data in the format we require, or that the data server will always work. Such unexpected situations will also be sources of errors 
        in our program. And although they are not directly dependent on us, it is our responsibility to anticipate potentially dangerous situations. <br><br> 
        If, for example, we write a calculator to which the user enters their values, then we should probably check if the divisor is not a zero before we do the division. 
        Theoretically, the user should know that we do not divide by zero, but we are responsible for the stability of the program. Do not believe the user or other systems. 
        Predict what may go wrong, and check the data received before you use it in your program.
        <br><br>
        Let's write a piece of code that will ask you to enter two numbers. We then want to display the result of dividing the first number by the second:
        <pre>
            <code>
                let sX = prompt("Enter the first number");
                let sY = prompt("Enter the second number");
                let x = Number(sX);
                let y = Number(sY);
                if (Number.isFinite(x) && Number.isFinite(y) && y !== 0) {
                    console.log(x / y);
                } else {
                    console.log("incorrect arguments");
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            You probably remember the <b id="spePara">prompt</b> function, which displays a dialog box into which we can enter a value. <b id="spePara">Prompt</b> will return the entered value, 
            always as a string (even if the user enters a number, e.g. they enter 1024, but we get the string "1024"). We are explicitly converting such a string into a number 
            using the <b id="spePara">Number</b> constructor (this will be discussed in detail in the next course). Since we disbelieve the user, we predict that instead of a number, 
            they could have given a string such as "abcd", or a second value equal to "0". Therefore, before we perform the division, we check whether we can accept the converted values. 
            We use the <b id="spePara">Number.isFinite</b> method for this purpose. It returns <b id="spePara">true</b> if the argument is a correct number, and <b id="spePara">false</b> if it is,
            for example <b id="spePara">Infinity</b> or <b id="spePara">NaN</b>. Additionally, we check if the divisor is not zero.
        </p>
