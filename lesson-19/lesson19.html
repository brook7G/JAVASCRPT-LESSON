    <h1 id="speH1">ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS</h1>
    <p>
        It is really important to brace yourself for this simple truth:
        <br><br>
        <b id="noticed">Errors will happen.</b><br><br>
        You have certainly witnessed, multiple times, different applications malfunctioning, becoming unstable, returning unexpected results, or even shutting down uncontrollably. 
        Unfortunately, we, the programmers, are responsible for most of these. Even if we didn't cause these problems directly, we probably didn't anticipate certain situations 
        that could lead to a program malfunctioning (e.g. lack of a network connection).
        <br><br>
        Errors in the operation of programs happen. We have to accept that, while trying to minimize their number and mitigate the damage they can potentially cause. 
        We can make errors at every stage of software development, from wrong design to common typos in the code we write. The errors will be the result of a 
        misconception when trying to solve a certain problem, the wrong use of the programming language, or the inability to predict strange user behavior. 
        Unfortunately, bugs in the code causing errors are an integral part of programming.
        <br><br>
        This fact is best expressed by the words of one of the founders of modern computer science, 
        Edsger W. Dijkstra:  "<b id="">If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in</b>".
