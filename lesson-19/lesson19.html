    <h1 id="speH1">ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS</h1>
    <p>
        It is really important to brace yourself for this simple truth:
        <br><br>
        <b id="noticed">Errors will happen.</b><br><br>
        You have certainly witnessed, multiple times, different applications malfunctioning, becoming unstable, returning unexpected results, or even shutting down uncontrollably. 
        Unfortunately, we, the programmers, are responsible for most of these. Even if we didn't cause these problems directly, we probably didn't anticipate certain situations 
        that could lead to a program malfunctioning (e.g. lack of a network connection).
        <br><br>
        Errors in the operation of programs happen. We have to accept that, while trying to minimize their number and mitigate the damage they can potentially cause. 
        We can make errors at every stage of software development, from wrong design to common typos in the code we write. The errors will be the result of a 
        misconception when trying to solve a certain problem, the wrong use of the programming language, or the inability to predict strange user behavior. 
        Unfortunately, bugs in the code causing errors are an integral part of programming.
        <br><br>
        This fact is best expressed by the words of one of the founders of modern computer science, 
        Edsger W. Dijkstra:  "<b id="spePara">If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in</b>".
        <br><br>
        <b id="noticed">Natural Languages and Communication Errors</b>
        <br><br>
        Programming languages are not by chance called languages. Just like natural languages, languages we use to communicate with other people, 
        programming languages are used to precisely formulate unambiguously interpretable sentences (instructions). And just like natural languages, 
        they have their grammar and vocabulary.
        <br><br>
        Grammar, or formally, the syntax of a programming language, is a set of rules defining the structure of the instructions (that is, the sentences of natural language). 
        These rules are usually very precise and specify, for example, the order in which we write certain keywords or operators.
        <br><br>
        Each language also has its own limited vocabulary, which is a list of words that can be used 
        to build instructions (that is, again, the sentences of a natural language). This picture is quite simplified, 
        but it should allow us to understand what errors can occur when using the language. To begin, 
        we will try to present the difference between various categories of errors using natural language, in this case, written English.
        <br><br>
        <h2 id="spePara">Natural languages and communication errors</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine that you are organizing a party by the lake for your friends. As the organizer, you explain to everyone how to get there, but as always in such situations, 
            someone gets lost. They’re almost there, but then they send a text message asking for additional tips. You send an answer, in which you tell them to turn right on 
            the first path after leaving the forest, and then drive for another 500 meters. Since you are still on your way, you ask them to wait on the spot. 
            The correct message could look like this: <br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn right into the first path, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            This is a sentence that we can treat as an instruction, unambiguously describing a certain procedure. 
            What would happen if we rushed when writing this information? Let's start with the missing punctuation marks: <br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">after leaving the forest turn right into the first path and drive 500m wait on the spot</b>
            <br><br>
            This is an example of a <b id="noticed">syntax error</b> (or more precisely, errors). In English, a declarative sentence should end with a period. 
            Probably the person who receives this message will easily guess what it is about, but formally it will be incorrect and ambiguous. 
            The interpreter (e.g. the JavaScript engine) or compiler cannot guess the meaning of what we have written. If such an error occurs, 
            it will require us to correct it. Such errors are usually very easy to detect automatically, and always need to be corrected. 
            They violate the language syntax rules. The program will not run if it contains a syntax error.
            <br><br>
            Let's restore the punctuation marks, but change one of the words, replacing “path” with the misspelled “pth”.
