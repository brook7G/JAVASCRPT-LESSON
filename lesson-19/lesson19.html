    <h1 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ERROR</span> AND <span id="spePara">EXCEPTIONS</span></h1>
    <p>
        It is really important to brace yourself for this simple truth:
        <br><br>
        <b id="noticed">Errors will happen.</b><br><br>
        You have certainly witnessed, multiple times, different applications malfunctioning, becoming unstable, returning unexpected results, or even shutting down uncontrollably. 
        Unfortunately, we, the programmers, are responsible for most of these. Even if we didn't cause these problems directly, we probably didn't anticipate certain situations 
        that could lead to a program malfunctioning (e.g. lack of a network connection).
        <br><br>
        Errors in the operation of programs happen. We have to accept that, while trying to minimize their number and mitigate the damage they can potentially cause. 
        We can make errors at every stage of software development, from wrong design to common typos in the code we write. The errors will be the result of a 
        misconception when trying to solve a certain problem, the wrong use of the programming language, or the inability to predict strange user behavior. 
        Unfortunately, bugs in the code causing errors are an integral part of programming.
        <br><br>
        This fact is best expressed by the words of one of the founders of modern computer science, 
        Edsger W. Dijkstra:  "<b id="spePara">If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in</b>".
        <br><br>
        <b id="noticed">Natural Languages and Communication Errors</b>
        <br><br>
        Programming languages are not by chance called languages. Just like natural languages, languages we use to communicate with other people, 
        programming languages are used to precisely formulate unambiguously interpretable sentences (instructions). And just like natural languages, 
        they have their grammar and vocabulary.
        <br><br>
        Grammar, or formally, the syntax of a programming language, is a set of rules defining the structure of the instructions (that is, the sentences of natural language). 
        These rules are usually very precise and specify, for example, the order in which we write certain keywords or operators.
        <br><br>
        Each language also has its own limited vocabulary, which is a list of words that can be used 
        to build instructions (that is, again, the sentences of a natural language). This picture is quite simplified, 
        but it should allow us to understand what errors can occur when using the language. To begin, 
        we will try to present the difference between various categories of errors using natural language, in this case, written English.
        <br><br>
        <h2 id="spePara">Natural languages and communication errors</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine that you are organizing a party by the lake for your friends. As the organizer, you explain to everyone how to get there, but as always in such situations, 
            someone gets lost. They’re almost there, but then they send a text message asking for additional tips. You send an answer, in which you tell them to turn right on 
            the first path after leaving the forest, and then drive for another 500 meters. Since you are still on your way, you ask them to wait on the spot. 
            The correct message could look like this: <br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn right into the first path, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            This is a sentence that we can treat as an instruction, unambiguously describing a certain procedure. 
            What would happen if we rushed when writing this information? Let's start with the missing punctuation marks: <br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">after leaving the forest turn right into the first path and drive 500m wait on the spot</b>
            <br><br>
            This is an example of a <b id="noticed">syntax error</b> (or more precisely, errors). In English, a declarative sentence should end with a period. 
            Probably the person who receives this message will easily guess what it is about, but formally it will be incorrect and ambiguous. 
            The interpreter (e.g. the JavaScript engine) or compiler cannot guess the meaning of what we have written. If such an error occurs, 
            it will require us to correct it. Such errors are usually very easy to detect automatically, and always need to be corrected. 
            They violate the language syntax rules. The program will not run if it contains a syntax error.
            <br><br>
            Let's restore the punctuation marks, but change one of the words, replacing “path” with the misspelled “pth”.
            <br><br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn right into the first <b style="color: red;">path</b>, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            Again, the recipient will probably guess what it is about, but the interpreter cannot afford to guess what the word “pth” may stand for, 
            because it does not know the meaning of such a word. Such an error is also easy to detect, because the word “pth” is not in the vocabulary of our language. 
            This is a <b id="noticed">semantic error</b>. In compiled programming languages, this type of error will not allow the compiling and running of the program. 
            In JavaScript, the interpreter will start the program and stop its execution after reaching such an instruction. 
            This specific type of semantic error in JavaScript is called a <b id="noticed">reference error</b>.
            <br><br>
            What happens if we replace a word by a typo with one that exists in our dictionary?
            <br><br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn right into the <b style="color: red;">fist</b> path, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            This time we’ve lost the letter “r” in the word “first” and got the word “fist”. If the sentence is analyzed by a person, 
            they will feel that something is wrong and start looking for an error – the word “fist” absolutely does not match the sentence, and they will probably guess what to replace it with. 
            This type of error will no longer be so easy to detect for an interpreter. The word is in the vocabulary, and the analysis has to be done in a broader context. It is also a semantic error.
            <br><br>
            The last category is logical errors. They are by far the hardest to find, because from a formal point of view, everything will look correct. We should tell our friend to turn right, 
            but busy with something else we rush to write ... left.
            <br><br>
            <b id="noticed" style="font-style: italic;">After leaving the forest, turn <b style="color: red;">left</b> into the first path, and drive 500m. Wait on the spot.</b>
            <br><br>
            Formally, everything looks correct: syntax, vocabulary, context. The information is consistent and unambiguous. And obviously incorrect. 
            The error will not be detected until someone tries to follow this instruction and disappears somewhere in the wilderness.
            <br><br>
            The last two errors may look quite similar at first glance, but they describe two completely different situations. 
            A logical error makes it possible to execute the instruction, but it will give the wrong result. An instruction with a semantic error will make no sense, 
            so most likely it will not be possible to execute it at all in this form. 
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ERRORS</span> AND <span id="spePara">EXCEPTIONS</span> in Javascript</h2>
    <p>
        Let's try to generate syntax, semantic, and logical errors in JavaScript, for tests in a controlled way. Let's say we want to write a simple arrow function called multiply, 
        which will multiply the two provided arguments:
        <pre>
            <code>
                let multiply = (a b) => a + b; // -> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
                let result = multiply(10, 20);
                console.log(result);

            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            In the example, there is a typical syntax error: we’ve forgotten about the comma between the parameters of the multiply function. 
            The error is detected by the JavaScript engine, which does not allow us to execute the program. We correct it, but we also make another error:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let multipl = (a, b) => a + b;
                    let result = multiply(10, 20); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: multiply is not defined
                    console.log(result);

                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
    </p>
