    <h1 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ERRORS</span> AND <span id="spePara">EXCEPTIONS</span> Part-2</h1>
    <h2 id="spePara">A few more details about JavaScript errors and exceptions</h2>
    <p>
        Let's try to organize the information about errors and exceptions, and above all, their handling. This time, let's look at the problem from a strictly functional point of view. 
        We will start with an overview of the most important types of errors detected by JavaScript, discuss in more detail the try... catch construction, and show that we can also 
        directly throw exceptions.

    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">Basic types of errors</h2>
    <p>
        There are a few underlying types of errors that JavaScript produces. Most often, especially at the beginning, you will encounter syntax and reference errors. 
        We will also discuss type and range errors.
        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">SyntaxError</span></h2>
        <p>
            As we previously said, a <b id="spePara">SyntaxError</b> appears when a code is ill-formed, when there are typos in the keywords, unmatching parentheses or brackets, etc. 
            The code can’t even be executed, as JavaScript isn’t able to understand it. The corresponding error is therefore thrown before the program is started.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    "use strict";
                    iff (true) { //-> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
                        console.log("true");
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In the example above, we’ve made a typo in the keyword <b id="spePara">if</b>, adding an additional letter f. 
                The JavaScript engine treats the unknown name as a function call (it finds the round brackets after iff) and 
                is surprised by the presence of a curly bracket.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ReferenceError</span></h2>
        <p>
            We’ve seen this one already. It occurs when we try to access a function or a variable that doesn't exist. The JavaScript engine does not know the meaning of the given name, 
            so it is an error that we will classify as a semantic error. The corresponding exception is thrown at the execution time of the program, when the wrong instruction is reached 
            (i.e. in JavaScript, semantic errors are run-time errors).
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let a = b; // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The attempt to declare variable a is unsuccessful because at the same time, we want to initialize it with the value of variable b. Variable b has not been declared anywhere before, 
                so the JavaScript engine does not know this name.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        fun(); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: fun is not defined
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                This time, we’ve tried to call the function fun. If we haven’t declared it before, and there is no function with this name among the standard JavaScript functions, the call ends in an error.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">TypeError</span></h2>
        <p>
            This type of error occurs when a certain value is not of the expected type (i.e. you try to perform an operation on it that is not acceptable). Typical examples are changing the constant value 
            or checking the length of a variable that is not a string. This error is particularly important when working with objects that are outside the scope of this course 
            (we will talk about them in the next part of the course). This is a typical <b id="spePara">run-time error</b>, so the appropriate exception will be thrown while the program is running, 
            after reaching the problematic instruction.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const someConstValue = 5;
                    someConstValue = 7; // -> Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Trying to store the new value to the constant someConstValue has failed for obvious reasons, resulting in a TypeError.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let someNumber = 10;
                        someNumber.length(); // -> Uncaught TypeError: someNumber.length is not a function
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                This time, we’ve tried to treat the contents of the variable <b id="spePara">someNumber</b> as a string, and check its length. 
                The JavaScript engine notices that the variable stores a number, and such an operation is not allowed.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">RangeError</span></h2>
        <p>
            This type of error is generated when you pass a value to a function that is outside its acceptable range.
            <br><br>
            Again, it is a <b id="noticed">run-time error</b>, and the exception is thrown while the program is running, after reaching the wrong instruction. In fact, this exception is more useful when writing your own 
            functions and handling errors. You can then throw an exception in certain situations.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let testArray1 = Array(10);
                    console.log(testArray1.length); // -> 10
                    let testArray2 = Array(-1); // -> Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length
                    console.log(testArray2.length);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In the example, we’ve attempted to create two arrays, using the constructor (i.e. de facto function) <b id="spePara">Array</b>. If we pass one argument to this function, 
                it will be treated as the size of the newly created array. 
                The first array (<b id="spePara">testArray1</b>) is created without any problem. As you can guess, creating a <b id="spePara">testArray2</b> array with a negative length fails.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">OTHER ERRORS</span></h2>
        <p>
            There are a few more error types: <b id="spePara">EvalError</b>, <b id="spePara">InternalError</b>, and <b id="spePara">URIError</b>, but they’re rather rare, and 
            we’ll come back to them if needed.
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1">THE <span id="spePara">try ... catch</span> STATEMENTS</h2>
        <p>
            As we said before, exceptions interrupt the program execution. The <b id="spePara">try...catch</b> construction, which we also mentioned before, 
            allows you to change this default action. The program will interrupt 
            what it is currently doing, but it will not terminate automatically. The syntax for <b id="spePara">try...catch</b> looks like this:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    try {
                        // code to try
                    } catch (error) {
                        // code to run in case of an error, which throw an exception
                    }                    
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The basic premise is simple: if we have a piece of code that can possibly go wrong, we can enclose it in the <b id="spePara">try</b> clause. 
                JavaScript will try to execute this code, and if any error occurs and an exception is thrown, 
                the code inside the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block will be executed; if the <b id="spePara">try</b> code is executed without errors, 
                then the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block is ignored. After executing the commands from the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block, 
                the program will continue to run from the first instruction outside the <b id="spePara">try...catch</b> statement.
                <br><br>
                Note that the <b id="spePara">catch</b> keyword is followed by parentheses containing the parameter error. This is a variable name that will hold information about the error 
                that was caught, and it can have any valid name, 
                but the names <b id="spePara">error</b>, <b id="spePara">err</b>, or just <b id="spePara">e</b>, are commonly used. In the case of an exception thrown by JavaScript, 
                the error object will contain information about 
                the error type, and is converted to a string to be logged or processed in any way the developer needs.
                <br><br>
                So let's modify the code that we saw earlier, and which we know for sure throws errors:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        try {
                            let a = b;
                        } catch (error) {
                            console.log("Caught " + error); // -> Caught ReferenceError: b is not defined
                        }
                        console.log("We handled the exception!"); // -> we handled the exception!                        
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                The statement that produces <b id="spePara">ReferenceError</b> is now inside the <b id="spePara">try</b> block. The result is that our code is no longer stopped by errors. 
                And we can react to it in the catch block. In this example, we log a message about the error. 
                The first error that is thrown in the <b id="spePara">try</b> block will always be caught, execution will jump to the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block, 
                and no further errors in the <b id="spePara">try</b> block will be caught. What's important is that after leaving the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block, 
                the program will continue to work normally (in our case it will write “We handled the exception!” on the console).
                <br><br>
                Note that <b id="spePara">try...catch</b> will not work on a <b id="spePara">SyntaxError</b>. This should not come as a surprise to you. As we have said several times before, 
                if the JavaScript engine detects a syntax error, it will not allow you to run the program. 
                If the program has not been run, it is rather hard to imagine that it could react somehow to what has happened.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">TASK</span></h2>
        <p id="front">
            Rewrite all examples from this chapter in such a way, that the errors will be caught by a <b id="spePara">try...catch</b> statement.
        </p>
    </p>

    <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">CONDITIONAL EXCEPTION HANDLING</span></h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes we want to be able to react differently to specific types of errors inside the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block. We can do this by using the operator 
        <b id="spePara">instanceof</b>. We’ll discuss the operator itself further down the road, because it’s a rather complicated topic. For now, it’s enough to know 
        how we can use it when handling errors.
        <br><br>
        The syntax for the <b id="spePara">instanceof</b> operator looks like this:
        <pre>
            <code>
                variable instanceof type
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            If, for example, we receive an error in the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block (passed as an error argument), we can check whether it is of the <b id="spePara">ReferenceError</b> 
            type as follows:
            <pre>
                <co>
                    let result = error instanceof ReferenceError;

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The operator <b id="spePara">instanceof</b> returns a boolean, so this expression will return <b id="spePara">true</b> if the error variable does indeed hold a type 
                <b id="spePara">ReferenceError</b>, and <b id="spePara">false</b> if it doesn’t. We can use <b id="spePara">if...else</b> or switch statements to then execute different 
                code in the case of different errors if needed.
                <br><br>
                In this example, we can see how we can react in a specific way only to the selected type of error:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let a2 = -2;
                        try {
                            a2 = b;
                        } catch (error) {
                            if (error instanceof ReferenceError) {
                                console.log("Reference error, reset a to -2"); // -> Reference error, reset a to -2
                                a2 = -2;
                            } else {
                                console.log("Other error - " + error);
                            }
                        }
                        console.log(a2); // -> -2
                    </code>
                </pre> 
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s important to know that any variable that gets declared using the <b id="spePara">let</b> keyword inside a <b id="spePara">try</b> block is not accessible 
            in the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block (nor in the <b id="spePara">finally</b> block, 
            which will be discussed in a moment). If you are not sure why this is the case, go back for a moment to the chapter on variable declarations and their scope of visibility 
            (the block scope topic).
        </p>
    </p>

    <h2 id="speH1">THE <span id="spePara">finally</span> STATEMENTS</h2>
    <p>
        The last optional block of the <b id="spePara">try</b> statement is the <b id="spePara">finally</b> block. It can be used with or without the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block, 
        and it’s always executed after <b id="spePara">try</b> and <b id="spePara">catch</b> blocks, regardless of whether any errors are thrown. 
        The syntax for <b id="spePara">try...finally</b> looks like this:
        <pre>
            <code>
                try {
                    // code to try
                } catch (error) {
                    // code to run in case of an error, which throw an exception
                } finally {
                    // code to run, regardless of the result of try...catch
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Let's do a little experiment. We will make a correct substitution to the variable a inside the <b id="spePara">try</b> block.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let a3 = 10;
                try {
                a3 = 5;
                } finally {
                console.log(a3); //-----> 5
                }
                console.log(a3); //----->5
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The new value has been stored, without calling an error, in variable a. Then the content of the <b id="spePara">finally</b> block is executed, i.e. the new value of our variable is 
            displayed on the console. The program continues after leaving the <b id="spePara">finally</b> block, displaying our variable again. Nothing surprising, everything simple and predictable.
            <br><br>
            Let's break down our example by trying to refer to a non-existent variable, b. As you can guess, this will generate a ReferenceError error:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let a = 10;
                    try {
                        a = b;  // ReferenceError
                    } finally {
                        console.log(a); // -> 10
                    }
                    console.log(a);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                What’s happening this time? The exception (<b id="spePara">ReferenceError</b>) interrupts the program in the <b id="spePara">try</b> block. Because the JavaScript engine cannot find the catch block, 
                it immediately jumps to the finally block, executing its contents and ending its work.
                <br><br>
                The <b id="spePara">finally</b> block can also be used together with the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block, as both of them are optional, but at least one of them is required by the <b id="spePara">try</b> statement, 
                and if none of them is present, a <b id="spePara">SyntaxError</b> is thrown.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let a = 10;
                        try {
                            a = b;  // ReferenceError
                        } catch (error) {
                            console.log("An Error!"); // -> An Error!
                        } finally {
                            console.log("Finally!"); // -> Finally!
                        }
                        console.log(a); // -> 10
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In this case, the exception causes a jump to the catch block, then to the finally block. The program then continues to work outside of the <b>try...catch</b>try...catch statement.
                </p>
            </p>
        </p>
    </p>

    <h2 id="speH1">Why should we use a <span id="spePara">finally</span> block?</h2>
    <p>
        This is a good question, especially since we can achieve almost the same result just by writing the code right outside the <b id="spePara">try...catch</b> statement, like this:
        <pre>
            <code>
                let a = 10;
                try {
                    a = b;  // ReferenceError
                } catch (error) {
                    console.log("An Error!");
                }
                console.log("Finally!");
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This code will have a similar result as the previous example: it will log <b id="spePara">An Error!</b> and then <b id="spePara">Finally!</b>. 
            It’s true that in this simple example, both <b id="spePara">scripts</b> will behave the same, but there are slight differences, and the most important is that the finally block will be executed 
            even when an error is thrown from the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let a = 10;
                    try {
                        a = b;  // First ReferenceError
                    } catch (error) {
                        console.log(b); // Second ReferenceError
                    
                    }
                    console.log("Finally!");
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Now the last <b id="spePara">console.log</b> call will never be executed, as another (this time uncaught) error is thrown in the <b id="spePara">catch</b> block. 
                This won’t happen if we use the <b id="spePara">finally</b> block like this:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let a = 10;
                        try {
                            a = b;  // First ReferenceError
                        } catch (error) {
                            console.log(b); // Second ReferenceError
                        
                        } finally {
                            console.log("Finally!");
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
        </p>
    </p>
