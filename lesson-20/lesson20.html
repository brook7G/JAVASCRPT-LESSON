    <h1 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ERRORS</span> AND <span id="spePara">EXCEPTIONS</span> Part-2</h1>
    <h2 id="spePara">A few more details about JavaScript errors and exceptions</h2>
    <p>
        Let's try to organize the information about errors and exceptions, and above all, their handling. This time, let's look at the problem from a strictly functional point of view. 
        We will start with an overview of the most important types of errors detected by JavaScript, discuss in more detail the try... catch construction, and show that we can also 
        directly throw exceptions.

    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">Basic types of errors</h2>
    <p>
        There are a few underlying types of errors that JavaScript produces. Most often, especially at the beginning, you will encounter syntax and reference errors. 
        We will also discuss type and range errors.
        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">SyntaxError</span></h2>
        <p>
            As we previously said, a <b id="spePara">SyntaxError</b> appears when a code is ill-formed, when there are typos in the keywords, unmatching parentheses or brackets, etc. 
            The code can’t even be executed, as JavaScript isn’t able to understand it. The corresponding error is therefore thrown before the program is started.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    "use strict";
                    iff (true) { //-> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
                        console.log("true");
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In the example above, we’ve made a typo in the keyword <b id="spePara">if</b>, adding an additional letter f. 
                The JavaScript engine treats the unknown name as a function call (it finds the round brackets after iff) and 
                is surprised by the presence of a curly bracket.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ReferenceError</span></h2>
        <p>
            We’ve seen this one already. It occurs when we try to access a function or a variable that doesn't exist. The JavaScript engine does not know the meaning of the given name, 
            so it is an error that we will classify as a semantic error. The corresponding exception is thrown at the execution time of the program, when the wrong instruction is reached 
            (i.e. in JavaScript, semantic errors are run-time errors).
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let a = b; // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The attempt to declare variable a is unsuccessful because at the same time, we want to initialize it with the value of variable b. Variable b has not been declared anywhere before, 
                so the JavaScript engine does not know this name.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        fun(); // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: fun is not defined
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                This time, we’ve tried to call the function fun. If we haven’t declared it before, and there is no function with this name among the standard JavaScript functions, the call ends in an error.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">TypeError</span></h2>
        <p>
            This type of error occurs when a certain value is not of the expected type (i.e. you try to perform an operation on it that is not acceptable). Typical examples are changing the constant value 
            or checking the length of a variable that is not a string. This error is particularly important when working with objects that are outside the scope of this course 
            (we will talk about them in the next part of the course). This is a typical <b id="spePara">run-time error</b>, so the appropriate exception will be thrown while the program is running, 
            after reaching the problematic instruction.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const someConstValue = 5;
                    someConstValue = 7; // -> Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Trying to store the new value to the constant someConstValue has failed for obvious reasons, resulting in a TypeError.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let someNumber = 10;
                        someNumber.length(); // -> Uncaught TypeError: someNumber.length is not a function
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                This time, we’ve tried to treat the contents of the variable someNumber as a string, and check its length. 
                The JavaScript engine notices that the variable stores a number, and such an operation is not allowed.
            </p>
