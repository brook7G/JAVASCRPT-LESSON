    <h1 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ERRORS</span> AND <span id="spePara">EXCEPTIONS</span> Part-2</h1>
    <h2 id="spePara">A few more details about JavaScript errors and exceptions</h2>
    <p>
        Let's try to organize the information about errors and exceptions, and above all, their handling. This time, let's look at the problem from a strictly functional point of view. 
        We will start with an overview of the most important types of errors detected by JavaScript, discuss in more detail the try... catch construction, and show that we can also 
        directly throw exceptions.

    </p>
    <h2 id="spePara">Basic types of errors</h2>
    <p>
        There are a few underlying types of errors that JavaScript produces. Most often, especially at the beginning, you will encounter syntax and reference errors. 
        We will also discuss type and range errors.
        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">SyntaxError</span></h2>
        <p>
            As we previously said, a <b id="spePara">SyntaxError</b> appears when a code is ill-formed, when there are typos in the keywords, unmatching parentheses or brackets, etc. 
            The code can’t even be executed, as JavaScript isn’t able to understand it. The corresponding error is therefore thrown before the program is started.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    "use strict";
                    iff (true) { //-> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
                        console.log("true");
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In the example above, we’ve made a typo in the keyword <b id="spePara">if</b>, adding an additional letter f. 
                The JavaScript engine treats the unknown name as a function call (it finds the round brackets after iff) and 
                is surprised by the presence of a curly bracket.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="speH1"><span id="spePara">ReferenceError</span></h2>
        <p>
            We’ve seen this one already. It occurs when we try to access a function or a variable that doesn't exist. The JavaScript engine does not know the meaning of the given name, 
            so it is an error that we will classify as a semantic error. The corresponding exception is thrown at the execution time of the program, when the wrong instruction is reached 
            (i.e. in JavaScript, semantic errors are run-time errors).
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let a = b; // -> Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
    </p>
