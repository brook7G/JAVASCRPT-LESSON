    <h1>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED</h1>
    <h2>CONDITIONAL OPERATORS</h2>
    <p>
        <p>
            We talked about the conditional (<b id="normal">ternary</b>) operator in the part of the course dedicated to operators. 
            It allows us to perform one of two actions based on the value of the first operand. 
            Most often it is used as an alternative to the <b id="normal">if ... else</b> instruction when you want to assign one of two values to a variable, 
            depending on a certain condition.
            <br>
            In such cases, it is simply shorter and a bit more readable than the <b id="normal">if ... else</b> construction.
            <br>
            Let's look at a simple example, so far without using a conditional operator:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let price = 100;
                    let shippingCost;

                    if(price > 50){
                        shippingCost = 0;
                    }else{
                        shippingCost = 5;
                    }
                    //
                    console.log(`price = ${price}, shipping = ${shippingCost}, `); // -> price = 100, shipping = 0
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The same code rewritten using the conditional operator looks a bit easier. 
            As a reminder: the first operand (before the question mark) is the condition to verify, 
            the second operand (between the question mark and the colon) will be returned if the condition is true, 
            and the third operand (after the colon) if the condition is false.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let priceOf=100;
                    let shippingCostOf= priceOf > 50 ? 0 : 5;

                    console.log(`price = ${priceOf}, shipping = ${shippingCostOf}`); // -> price = 100, shipping = 0
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The conditional operator returns the values of the second or third operand, but if they are complex expressions, it will calculate them first. 
            You can use this fact to place the commands to be executed conditionally as these operands.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let start =  confirm("start");
                    start ? alert("here we go!!") : console.log("Aborted!");
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it would make more sense to save the same piece of code in the following form:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let startAgain = confirm("Start Again");
                    let message = startAgain ? "here we go!!" : "Aborted!";
                    alert(message);
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s possible to have longer code as operands, but it’s better to use if statements, as it is much clearer what intention the developer had when writing the code.
