    <h1>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED</h1>
    <h2>CONDITIONAL OPERATORS</h2>
    <p>
        <p>
            We talked about the conditional (<b id="normal">ternary</b>) operator in the part of the course dedicated to operators. 
            It allows us to perform one of two actions based on the value of the first operand. 
            Most often it is used as an alternative to the <b id="normal">if ... else</b> instruction when you want to assign one of two values to a variable, 
            depending on a certain condition.
            <br>
            In such cases, it is simply shorter and a bit more readable than the <b id="normal">if ... else</b> construction.
            <br>
            Let's look at a simple example, so far without using a conditional operator:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let price = 100;
                    let shippingCost;

                    if(price > 50){
                        shippingCost = 0;
                    }else{
                        shippingCost = 5;
                    }
                    //
                    console.log(`price = ${price}, shipping = ${shippingCost}, `); // -> price = 100, shipping = 0
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The same code rewritten using the conditional operator looks a bit easier. 
            As a reminder: the first operand (before the question mark) is the condition to verify, 
            the second operand (between the question mark and the colon) will be returned if the condition is true, 
            and the third operand (after the colon) if the condition is false.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let priceOf=100;
                    let shippingCostOf= priceOf > 50 ? 0 : 5;

                    console.log(`price = ${priceOf}, shipping = ${shippingCostOf}`); // -> price = 100, shipping = 0
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The conditional operator returns the values of the second or third operand, but if they are complex expressions, it will calculate them first. 
            You can use this fact to place the commands to be executed conditionally as these operands.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let start =  confirm("start");
                    start ? alert("here we go!!") : console.log("Aborted!");
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it would make more sense to save the same piece of code in the following form:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let startAgain = confirm("Start Again");
                    let message = startAgain ? "here we go!!" : "Aborted!";
                    alert(message);
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s possible to have longer code as operands, but it’s better to use if statements, as it is much clearer what intention the developer had when writing the code.
            <br><br>
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2>THE Switch...case STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>
        <p>
            The last type of statement that is used for conditional code execution is a switch statement. 
            We’re only talking about it now because, among other things, compared to the if statement, it is not a construction used especially often. 
            It’s somewhat similar to nested if … else statements, but instead of evaluating different expressions, 
            switch evaluates one conditional expression and then tries to match its value to one of the given cases. Here is the syntax of the switch statement:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    switch(expression){
                        case value1:
                            block of code
                            break;
                        case value2:
                            block of code
                            break;
                        default:
                            block of code
                            
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            It starts with the <b id="normal">switch</b> keyword followed by the expression to be evaluated in parentheses. 
            Next is the code block that has one or more case clauses (technically it’s possible to have zero cases, 
            but this wouldn’t be very useful) followed directly by a value corresponding to this case and a colon character. 
            After the colon, there is a block of code that will be executed when the expression is evaluated to this case value. 
            The block of code optionally ends with the <b id="normal">break</b> keyword. All cases follow the same template. 
            <br><br>
            Additionally, a special case named <b id="normal">default</b> can be present (by convention placed on the end of the switch statement; however, it isn’t required). 
            The <b id="normal">default</b> case is executed when none of the cases matches the expression. 
            The evaluation itself is made with a strict comparison operator <b id="normal">(===)</b> so not only must the value match, 
            but also the type of case value and the expression.
            <br><br>
            To understand it better, run the following code:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let gate=prompt("choose a gate: a, b, or c");
                    let win = false;

                    switch(gate){
                        case "a":
                            alert("GATE A: empty");
                            break;
                        case "b":
                            alert("GATE B: main prize");
                            break;
                        case "c":
                            alert("GATE C: empty");
                            break;
                        default: 
                        alert("No Gate: " + String(gate));           
                    }
                    if(win){
                        alert("Winner!")
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
    </p>
    <h2>SECTION SUMMARY</h2>
    <p><img src="summary.png" alt="">
        Control flow statements are an essential part of almost any application, and we use them to check and handle user input, 
        values fetched from the web, or the results of almost any operation.

        They allow us to build flexible and reactive applications. The most universal construction is the <b id="normal">if ... else</b> statement.

        However, do not forget that in some situations it will be more convenient to use a conditional operator or switch statement.
    </p>
    <h2>SECTION PRACTICE</h2>
    <p>
        <b id="front">Exercise 1:</b> Write a script that will ask the user to input a number. <br>

        Display the message <b id="noticed">"Bingo!"</b> when the number is greater than 90 but less than 110, otherwise display the message: <b id="noticed">"Miss"</b>. 
        Use the if statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b id="front">Exercise 2:</b> <b id="noticed">Rewrite</b> the code from the <b id="noticed">previous task</b>, 
        replacing <b id="noticed">if</b> with a <b id="noticed">ternary</b> conditional operator.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b id="front">Exercise 3:</b> Write a simple calculator application. <b>Ask the user for the following input</b>, one by one: <b id="noticed">two numbers</b> 
        and a character representing a mathematical operation, one of <b id="noticed">"+"</b>, <b id="noticed">"-"</b>, <b id="noticed">"*"</b>, <b id="noticed">"/"</b>. 
        If the user input is valid, calculate the result and show it to the user. 
        If the user input is invalid, display a message that informs the user that an error has occurred.
        <br><br>
        <b>Remember </b>that the value returned by the prompt function is of the type string. You can use the <b id="noticed">Number.isNaN</b> method to check if you 
        get the correct number after conversion. For example, calling <b id="noticed">Number.isNaN(10)</b> will return <b>false</b>, while <b id="noticed">Number.isNaN(NaN)</b> 
        will return <b>true</b>.
