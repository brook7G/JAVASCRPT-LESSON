    <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;" >This is Lesson-4 of Learning <b style="color: brown; font-size: 29px;">JAVA SCRIPT</b>. In this part of Lesson we are going to discuss about :</p>
    <p style="color: black;">
        Quite recently we introduced the concepts of <b>method</b> and <b>property</b>. They appeared when we were talking about the String type. These were functions and values related to a specific object. 
        Now it turns out that an array is implemented as an object in JavaScript, 
        so it probably also has its methods and properties. And indeed it does. 
        There are many very useful methods that help us to work with arrays, such as <b>combining</b> arrays, <b>cutting</b> out elements, <b>sorting</b>, or <b>filtering</b>.

        <ul style="color: rgb(255, 0, 153);">
            <li>A. LENGTH:
                <p>The length property is used to get information about the length (the number of elements) of the array (including empty positions between existing elements).</p>
            </li>

            <li>B. INDEXOF:
                <p>The <b>indexOf</b> method is used to search the array to locate a given value. If the value is found (the element is in the array), its index (position) will be returned.     
                   The method <b>returns <b style="color: blue;">-1</b></b> if the element is not found. If there is more than one element with the same value in the array, the index of the first element is returned.
                
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>C. PUSH:

                <p>
                    The <b>push</b> method places the element given as its argument at the <b>end</b> of the array. 
                    The length of the array is increased by <b>1</b>, and the new element is inserted on the <b>right</b> (it has the largest index of all elements).
                </p>

                <img src="pushMethod.png" alt="IF THE IMG IS NOT VISIBLE FIND 'pushMethod.png' IN LESSON-6 FOLDER ">

            </li>

            <li>D. UNSHIFT:

                <p>
                    The <b>unshift</b> method works similarly to <b>push</b>, the difference being that a new element is added to the <b>beginning</b> of the array. 
                    The array length is increased by <b>1</b>, all the <b style="color: rgb(168, 133, 21);">old elements are moved to the right</b> and the new element is placed in the empty space that has been created at the beginning of the array. 
                    The index of the new element is <b>0</b>.
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>E. POP: 
                <p>
                    The <b>pop</b> method allows you to <b>remove</b> the <b>last</b> element from the array. As a result of its execution, the element with the largest index is returned, while at the same time it is removed from the original array. 
                    The length of the array is obviously reduced by <b>1</b>.

            </p>

            </li>

            <li>F. SHIFT:
                <p>
                    The <b>shift</b> method works similarly to <b>pop</b>, only this time we remove the element from the <b>beginning</b> of the array (with the index 0). 
                    The removed element is returned by the method, all other elements are shifted to the <b>left</b>, completing the empty space. The length of the original array is <b>reduced</b> by <b>1</b>.
                </p>

                <img src="shiftMethod.png" alt="IF THE IMG IS NOT VISIBLE FIND 'popMethod.png' IN LESSON-6 FOLDER">

            </li>

            <li>G. REVERSE:
                <p>
                    The <b>reverse</b> method reverses the <b>order</b> of elements in the array. As a result of its calling, the <b>first element</b> of the original array will become <b>the last</b>, the second last but one, and so on.
                </p>

                <img src="reverseMethod.png" alt="IF THE IMG IS NOT VISIBLE FIND 'reverseMethod.png' IN LESSON-6 FOLDER">
            </li>

            <li>H. SLICE:
                <p>
                    The <b>slice</b> method allows you to create a <b>new array</b> from selected elements of the original array. 
                    <b>Calling the method does not affect</b> the original array. The method takes either one or two integer values as arguments.
                    <p style="color: black;">The basic combinations are:
                        
                        <ol>:- <b>one argument larger than 0 –</b> all elements from the index given as an argument to the end of the array are copied;</ol>
                        <ol>:- <b>two arguments larger than 0 –</b> the element from the index specified as the first argument to the element specified as the second argument are copied;</ol>
                        <ol>:- <b>two arguments, first positive, second negative –</b> all elements from the specified index to the end of the array are copied, except for the specified number of the last elements (e.g. argument -3 means that we do not copy the last three elements)</ol>
                        <ol>:- <b>one negative argument –</b> the specified number of the last elements are copied to the end of the array (e.g. -2 means that you copy the last two elements).</ol>
                        

                        </ol> 
                    </p>
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>I. CONCAT:
                <p>
                    The <b>concat</b> method <b>creates a new array</b> by attaching elements from the array given as an argument to the original array elements. 
                    The method changes neither the original array nor the array specified as an argument.

                </p>
            </li>

        </ul>
    </p>
