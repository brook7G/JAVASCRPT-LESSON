    <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;" >This is Lesson-4 of Learning <b style="color: brown; font-size: 29px;">JAVA SCRIPT</b>. In this part of Lesson we are going to discuss about :</p>
    <p style="color: black;">
        Quite recently we introduced the concepts of <b>method</b> and <b>property</b>. They appeared when we were talking about the String type. These were functions and values related to a specific object. 
        Now it turns out that an array is implemented as an object in JavaScript, 
        so it probably also has its methods and properties. And indeed it does. 
        There are many very useful methods that help us to work with arrays, such as <b>combining</b> arrays, <b>cutting</b> out elements, <b>sorting</b>, or <b>filtering</b>.

        <ul style="color: rgb(255, 0, 153);">
            <li>A. LENGTH:
                <p>The length property is used to get information about the length (the number of elements) of the array (including empty positions between existing elements).</p>
            </li>

            <li>B. INSTANCE_OF:
                <p>The <b>indexOf</b> method is used to search the array to locate a given value. If the value is found (the element is in the array), its index (position) will be returned.     
                   The method <b>returns <b style="color: blue;">-1</b></b> if the element is not found. If there is more than one element with the same value in the array, the index of the first element is returned.</p>
