    <h1>CONDITIONAL EXECUTION</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Conditional execution</b>, or <b>control flow statements</b>, have been mentioned a few times already, and now it’s time to examine them in detail. 
            This is a very important topic, as control flow statements are essential not only to JavaScript, but to programming in general. 
            Without the ability to react and change its behavior, any code would always do the same thing. 
            Of course, this is sometimes exactly what we need, but most of the time we need responsiveness and the ability to handle different situations in the code.
            <br>
            <br>
            We can imagine our program as a tree that starts from the trunk and gradually splits it into subsequent branches. 
            The trunk is the beginning of the program, and each conditional instruction is a reflection of a new branch. 
            Conditional instructions are executed on the basis of the user's decision, results of previous calculations, or other information that the program will take into account. 
            JavaScript provides a few ways to branch code execution, based on arbitrary conditions. From this chapter on, 
            there will be more tasks and code that you will need to write, as now you should have almost all the necessary tools to hand.

            <h3>The <b>if</b> statements</h3>
            <p>
                <b>The if statement</b> is the first and simplest control flow instruction available in JavaScript. 
                It has a few forms, but in its basic form, it <b>checks a given condition</b>, and <b>depending on</b> its <b>Boolean value</b>, either <b>executes a block</b> of code, or <b>skips it</b>. 
                The syntax looks like this:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        if(condition){
                            block of code
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The <b>if</b> keyword <b>needs to be followed </b>by the <b>expression in parentheses</b>, which will be <b>evaluated to the Boolean</b>, and <b>if the result is true</b>, 
                    the <b>block of code</b> that follows the conditional expression is <b>executed</b>. 
                    <b>If the expression evaluates to false</b>, the <b>block of code</b> will <b>NOT be executed</b>. 
                    <b>The code block</b> should be <b>separated</b> using <b>curly brackets</b>.
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            let isUserReady = confirm("Are you ready?");
                            console.log(isUserReady );

                            if (isUserReady){
                                alert("User is ready!!");
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the <b>example</b>, an alert with the message <b>"User is ready!" </b>will <b>show only when</b> the <b>user closes the 
                        confirm dialog box</b> by <b>clicking the OK button</b>. 
                    But <b>if the user closes</b> the <b>"Are you ready?"</b> confirmation box without clicking OK, the "User ready!" message will never be shown.
                    <br>
                    In the example, there is one line inside the if block of code, which means that we could omit the curly brackets around that block. 
                    However, while it may look tempting to do so, it’s always better to use curly brackets. That way, the code is cleaner and easier to read, 
                    and it also saves you from a very common error that happens when trying to add another instruction inside an if block and forgetting to add brackets.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the example below, we probably forgot to close the two commands inside the block directly behind the if command. 
                    Check how this piece of code will behave when you run it, depending on your answer to the question "Are you ready?":
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            let isUserReady2 = confirm("Are you ready buddy?");
                            if (isUserReady2)
                                console.log("user-2 is ready!!");
                                alert("user-2 is ready!!");

                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        <b>Fix this code by closing both commands</b> (console.log and alert) in the block. Check how this will affect the program.
                    </p>
                </p>
            </p>
