    <h1>CONDITIONAL EXECUTION</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Conditional execution</b>, or <b>control flow statements</b>, have been mentioned a few times already, and now it’s time to examine them in detail. 
            This is a very important topic, as control flow statements are essential not only to JavaScript, but to programming in general. 
            Without the ability to react and change its behavior, any code would always do the same thing. 
            Of course, this is sometimes exactly what we need, but most of the time we need responsiveness and the ability to handle different situations in the code.
            <br>
            <br>
            We can imagine our program as a tree that starts from the trunk and gradually splits it into subsequent branches. 
            The trunk is the beginning of the program, and each conditional instruction is a reflection of a new branch. 
            Conditional instructions are executed on the basis of the user's decision, results of previous calculations, or other information that the program will take into account. 
            JavaScript provides a few ways to branch code execution, based on arbitrary conditions. From this chapter on, 
            there will be more tasks and code that you will need to write, as now you should have almost all the necessary tools to hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>The <b>if</b> statements</h3>
            <p>
                <b>The if statement</b> is the first and simplest control flow instruction available in JavaScript. 
                It has a few forms, but in its basic form, it <b>checks a given condition</b>, and <b>depending on</b> its <b>Boolean value</b>, either <b>executes a block</b> of code, or <b>skips it</b>. 
                The syntax looks like this:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        if(condition){
                            block of code
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The <b>if</b> keyword <b>needs to be followed </b>by the <b>expression in parentheses</b>, which will be <b>evaluated to the Boolean</b>, and <b>if the result is true</b>, 
                    the <b>block of code</b> that follows the conditional expression is <b>executed</b>. 
                    <b>If the expression evaluates to false</b>, the <b>block of code</b> will <b>NOT be executed</b>. 
                    <b>The code block</b> should be <b>separated</b> using <b>curly brackets</b>.
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            let isUserReady = confirm("Are you ready?");
                            console.log(isUserReady );

                            if (isUserReady){
                                alert("User is ready!!");
}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the <b>example</b>, an alert with the message <b>"User is ready!" </b>will <b>show only when</b> the <b>user closes the 
                        confirm dialog box</b> by <b>clicking the OK button</b>. 
                    But <b>if the user closes</b> the <b>"Are you ready?"</b> confirmation box without clicking OK, the "User ready!" message will never be shown.
                    <br>
                    In the example, there is one line inside the if block of code, which means that we could omit the curly brackets around that block. 
                    However, while it may look tempting to do so, it’s always better to use curly brackets. That way, the code is cleaner and easier to read, 
                    and it also saves you from a very common error that happens when trying to add another instruction inside an if block and forgetting to add brackets.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the example below, we probably forgot to close the two commands inside the block directly behind the if command. 
                    Check how this piece of code will behave when you run it, depending on your answer to the question "Are you ready?":
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            let isUserReady2 = confirm("Are you ready buddy?");
                            if (isUserReady2)
                                console.log("user-2 is ready!!");
                                alert("user-2 is ready!!");

                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        <b>Fix this code by closing both commands</b> (console.log and alert) in the block. Check how this will affect the program.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p><b id="normal">NOTE</b><br>
                    We talked about code blocks, and more specifically, their scope, in the section devoted to variables. 
                    If you don't remember this topic, it would be good for you to return to it for a while. 
                    As a quick reminder – we use program blocks whenever, for some reason, we want to separate a piece of code to form a logical whole. 
                    Conditional instructions are a good example. 
                    Using the if instruction and closing the selected instructions in the block (using curly brackets), 
                    we can cause them to be executed only when certain circumstances occur (i.e. the condition we’ve invented is fulfilled). 
                    Remember that variables and constants declared using let and const inside a block are local, that is, their scope is limited to that particular block. 
                    Also make sure to use indentations in the blocks to make the code more readable. In other words, move the instructions in them to the right.
                    <br><br>
                    As we have already mentioned, by using data blocks, we can make the constants and variables declared inside them local (not visible to the outside). 
                    We discussed this in detail in the variable section, so here we will only present a practical example to remind you:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                                const unitPrice =10;
                                const pieces = prompt('How many pieces do you want to order',0);

                                if(pieces>0){
                                    const totalPrice = pieces * unitPrice;
                                    console.log(totalPrice);
                                }
                                console.log('total price:',totalPrice);
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        The total variable is declared inside the block. We can put a value to it, we can read it – but all this only inside the block. 
                        Attempting to refer to it outside the block will end in an error. The interpreter will inform us that it does not know such a variable.
                        <br>
                        This is a good moment to remind you of logical and comparison operations, as they’re most commonly used as conditions, 
                        especially in more complex situations. Let's take a look at the example:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                let userAge=24;
                                let isFemale=false;
                                let points=700;
                                let cartValue=399;
                                let shippingCost=9.99;

                                if(userAge>0){
                                    if(cartValue >= 400 || points >= 500){
                                        shippingCost = 0;
                                    }
                                }
                                console.log('shippingCost:',shippingCost);
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            In this example, to set the <b id="normal">shippingCost</b> to zero, the userAge needs to be over 21. 
                            The second if is calculated and needs the cartValue to be over or equal to 400, or the points to be greater than or equal to 500.
                            <br><br>
                            Another way to write the same thing is to use the logical AND operator. We can now remove one if instruction and describe everything as one,
                             more complex condition. Please note that we used additional parentheses to group the selected logical operations. 
                             This will allow us to force their execution precedence.
                             <pre>
                                <code>
                                    if(userAge > 21 && cartValue >= 400 || points >= 500){
                                        shippingCost = 0;
                                    }
                                </code>
                             </pre>   
                             <p>
                                Here the condition will be evaluated to true when:
                                <br><br>

                                <b id="normal">>>>>>></b>userAge is greater than 21 AND;<br>
                                <b id="normal">>>>>>></b>cartValue is greater than or equal to 300 OR points is greater than or equal to 500.
                                So, we need to have the first condition met, and at least one from the second or third conditions.
                             </p>
                        </p>
                    </p>
