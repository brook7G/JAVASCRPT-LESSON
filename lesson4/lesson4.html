    <p>This is Lesson-4 of Learning JAVA SCRIPT. In this part of Lesson we are going to discuss about :</p>
    <h1>1.TYPE CONVERSION
        <h2>Primitive construction functions</h2>
        <p>
            Using literals is not the only way to create variables of the given primitive types. 
            The second option is to make them using constructor functions. These types of functions 
            are mainly used in JavaScript for object-oriented programming, which is outside the scope of our course.</p>
    </h1>

    <P>
        <ol>->the function String will by default create and return an empty string â€“ primitive "";</ol>
        <ol>->the function Number will by default create and return the value 0;</ol>
        <ol>->the function Boolean will by default create and return the value of false.</ol>
        <ol>->The function BigInt, unlike other constructor functions, requires you to pass some initial value to it. 
            This can be an integer number that will be converted to a BigInt (see examples ).
        </ol>
        But creating default values is not impressive at all. We can accomplish these using literals. <br> 
        So what do we use these functions for? Well, we use them in type conversions.
    </P >      

    <h1>2.CONVERSION
        <p> 
            The simplest example is when we have a number, but we need to add it to some text.
            <ol>
                <li>CONVERSION TO STRING
                    <p>
                        Conversions are the easiest to understand, as they try to directly change the value to a string, and this can be done for all primitive types.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>CONVERSION TO NUMBER
                    <p>
                        Conversion to a number is not as obvious as conversion to a string. It works as expected for strings that represent actual numbers, <br>
                        like "14", "-72.134", or strings that represent numbers in scientific notation, like "2e3", or special number values like "NaN" or "Infinity".
                        <br>
                        However, the string can also contain numbers in hexadecimal, octal, and binary format. They must be preceded by 0x, 0o, or 0b respectively. <br>
                        For any string that cannot be converted to a special value, NaN (not a number) is returned.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>CONVERSION TO BOOLEAN
                    <p>
                        Conversions to Boolean follow simple rules, as we can only have one of two values: true or false.
                       
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>CONVERION TO BigInt
                    <p>
                        In order for conversions to a BigInt to succeed, we require a Number or String representing a number as a value to be converted. 
                        Values for conversion can be given in the default decimal form, as well as in hexadecimal, octal, or binary form. 
                        <br>We can also use exponential notation, but only for Number arguments. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>IMPLICIT CONVERSION
                    <p>
                        Conversions can also happen automatically, and they happen all the time. <br>
                        when we try to perform an addition when one of the arguments is a string, 
                        JavaScript will convert the rest of the arguments to a string as well. <br>
                        Subtraction with a string, however, doesn't make much sense, so in that case JavaScript converts everything to Numbers.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
