    <h4>BIRUK is good at PROBLEM SOLVING lets <span>HIRE</span> him </h4>

    <p>This is Lesson-4 of Learning JAVA SCRIPT. In this part of Lesson we are going to discuss about :</p>
    <h1>1.TYPE CONVERSION
        <h2>Primitive construction functions</h2>
        <p>
            Using literals is not the only way to create variables of the given primitive types. 
            The second option is to make them using constructor functions. These types of functions 
            are mainly used in JavaScript for object-oriented programming, which is outside the scope of our course.</p>
    </h1>

    <P>
        <ol>->the function String will by default create and return an empty string â€“ primitive "";</ol>
        <ol>->the function Number will by default create and return the value 0;</ol>
        <ol>->the function Boolean will by default create and return the value of false.</ol>
        <ol>->The function BigInt, unlike other constructor functions, requires you to pass some initial value to it. 
            This can be an integer number that will be converted to a BigInt (see examples ).
        </ol>
        But creating default values is not impressive at all. We can accomplish these using literals. <br> 
        So what do we use these functions for? Well, we use them in type conversions.
    </P >      

    <h1>2.CONVERSION
        <p> 
            The simplest example is when we have a number, but we need to add it to some text.

        </p>
